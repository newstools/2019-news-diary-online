Nigeria’s U-20 team, Falconets,
emerged champions of the women’s football tournament at the 12th African Games
in Rabat on Thursday, after a 3-2 penalty shoot-out triumph over their
counterparts from Cameroon. The keenly-contested game between
the two teams, who had battled to a 1-1 draw in the group stage match eight
days earlier, ended 0-0 after regulation and extra time at the Stade Boubker
Aamar outside Rabat. Penalty shoot-out followed and
Falconets, one of only four teams to have featured in every edition of the FIFA
U20 Women’s World Cup since the competition started 17 years ago, triumphed. The victory was the first gold for
the Falconets at the African Games in 12 years, having not qualified for the
10th edition in Mozambique in 2011, and finishing outside the medals’ range in
Brazzaville four years ago. It was also a fitting accomplishment
to bid farewell to the first captain of the Falconets team, Ifeanyichukwu
Chiejine, whose remains were committed to mother earth in Lagos, also on
Thursday. (NAN)
