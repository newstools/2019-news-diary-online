The Ohanaeze Youth Council Worldwide
has warned the Igbo against attacking President Muhmmadu Buhari in Japan. According to a statement emailed to
Newsdiaryonline Monday, Mazi Okechukwu isiguzoro, President General, Ohanaeze
Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide,  said, “Attacking
President Muhammadu Buhari in Japan is not an achievement, but will portray
Igbos before the international community as terrorists which we can never be,
irrespective of that Igbos are facing a Herculaneum tasks politically and
economically in Nigeria this period, coupled with the uprising of insecurity
challenges emanating from suspected Fulani Herdsmen. “We should not worsen the situation
by introducing violent protests and approach (that)  will attract reprisal assault on the peace
loving Igbos staying in Northern Nigeria.” Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council
Worldwide called  Igbos planning any
violent Protests in Japan or planned arrest of President Muhammadu Buhari to
put off  what it called such “senseless
efforts as it’s endangering the lives and properties of Igbos living in 19
Northern States, apart from the risk of being jailed or deportations from
Japan, anything else that happened to Buhari will certainly put Igbos in fear
and Danger.” Ohanaeze said “Most of those
sponsoring the supposed planned attack or trying to carry out the assualt on
President Buhari,do not have any investment in Nigeria particularly the South
East. Igbos are wiser than yesterday. Many Ipob leaders including Nnamdi
Kanu,do not have any investment in South East or Biafra land. Many of them are
yet to build a house in the South East,We are aware many of the people staging
the protests should remember that they’re breadwinners of their families in
Nigeria.We should vigorously defend our land while building bridges across the
Niger. “We are Praying for Ipob leaders to
repent and not to jeopardize the peaceful atmosphere we have experienced in the
South East since the War ended in 1970,” the statement said.
