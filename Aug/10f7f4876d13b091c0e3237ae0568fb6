Mr Sola Oni, a chartered stockbroker and Chief Executive Officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, ascribed the upward trend to the swearing in of the ministers as a symbol of commencement of economic recovery. “Stock market is never static. It responds to companies’ performance either good or bad, demand and supply and speculation, also called market hearsay. “Beyond this, it aggregates investors’ reaction to information from the economic and political landscape. “Our market is forward looking and investors buy into future of companies with expectation of better returns. “But the same investors are ready to offload once they are not comfortable with available piece of information from the political and economic landscape. “In the process of upswing and downswing, real investors take position, while speculators change position,” Oni said. Analysts at United Capital Plc said that: “Notably, market participants took the crystalisation of the swearing-in with some positivity, perhaps with the expectation that hastened fiscal policies and implementation of plans might revive the nation’s lack lustre growth.” Market breadth closed positive with 22 gainers and 13 losers.
