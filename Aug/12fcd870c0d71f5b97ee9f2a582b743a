President Muhammadu
Buhari has  felicitated with national
female basketball team, D’Tigress, for a highly impressive outing at the FIBA
Women’s AfroBasket 2019 in Dakar, Senegal, that saw them coasting home to
victory at the finals, winning the hosts, 60-55. A statement by Presidential
Spokesman, Garba Shehu Sunday night said President Buhari congratulated the
team for the remarkably synergized play that enabled them to outpace and
outplay all the teams at the tournament to retain the title they won in 2017,
further consolidating their position as African champions with four titles. The President commended  the team for discipline, maturity and focus
all through the tournament, and deliberateness in promoting the Nigerian flag
and accompanying virtues of resilience, persistence and dogged pursuit until
victory was achieved. According to Shehu, “President
Buhari sends appreciation to all the officials and technical hands that guided
the team to win the African title, urging them to remain focused in deploying
such energy and talent in subsequent global tournaments.”
