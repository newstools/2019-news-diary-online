#TrackNigeria –A Joint Inter-Agency
Team led by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences
Commission (ICPC) has arrested 37 officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps
(FRSC) for allegedly extorting money from motorists on Nigerian highways. A statement by ICPC on Monday said the
Team, comprising officials of ICPC, FRSC and the Department of State Security
(DSS) also arrested five persons said to be agents of the corps officials in a
sting operation carried out simultaneously in the six geo-political zones. The Team struck on Friday 16th August,
2019, following the receipt of a complaint from the management of the Corps of
massive extortion of money from motorists on the highways by its patrol teams. The FRSC management had, in the complaint
to the Commission, observed that incidents of extortion were rife in the six
states of Kaduna, Bauchi, Abia, Rivers, Kogi and Ogun. Based on this, the ICPC-led Team
went into action and identified the notorious spots in each of the
aforementioned states to include Aba in Abia State; Ahoada, Ajaokuta, Itori,
Torro and Gwantu in Rivers, Kogi, Ogun, Bauchi and Kaduna States respectively. 13 FRSC officials and two civilians
were arrested in Aba in the South-east while 24 other FRSC officials and three
civilians were arrested from various spots on roads spread across the other
geo-political zones. Findings from the Joint Inter-Agency
Team indicated that various sums of money were found on the arrested Corps
officials during the sting operations before they were taken into ICPC custody. However, all the officials arrested
and three civilian accomplices have been granted administrative bail, and will
be prosecuted by the Commission at the conclusion of investigations.
