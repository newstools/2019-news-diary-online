#TrackNigeria Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Tuesday it was tweaking its policies to allow users to see and control the data that other websites and apps shared with the social network to improve targeted advertising. The company defines the data, for example, as when a clothing website shares information with Facebook on browsing activity of a user, as “Off-Facebook Activity”. “We are starting by gradually making Off-Facebook Activity available to people in Ireland, South Korea and Spain,” Facebook executives said in a blog post. The social media site said that if a user cleared their off-Facebook activity, Facebook would remove the user’s identifying information from the data that apps and websites chose to send. “We won’t know which websites you visited or what you did there, and we won’t use any of the data you disconnect to target ads to you on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger,” he said. Facebook said it expects this could have some impact on its business. The tech heavyweight has faced criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices. In July, the company agreed to a record-setting 5 billion dollars privacy settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The settlement is awaiting court approval. (Reuters/NAN)
