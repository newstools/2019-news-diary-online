The attempt by Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission, EFCC, to execute a search warrant on the residences of a former
Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode was on Tuesday August 20, 2019
resisted by hoodlums loyal to the governor,EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren ,
said in a statement He said the
thugs attacked the Operatives and vandalized their vehicle. According to
the Commission’s Spokesman, the Commission had obtained valid warrant to
conduct search on Ambode’s residences
in Park View,  Ikoyi and country home in Epe,  as part of ongoing
investigation of alleged malfeasance. The statement
said,”However, the Commission’s operatives were attacked and prevented from
executing the search warrant in Epe by irate youths who injured three officers
and damaged EFCC official vehicle. He added “The attack was totally unprovoked as the Commission’s
operatives were civic and did not molest anybody. “The
Commission therefore frowns at the attempt to manipulate the video of the
search to create the wrong impression that officers of the agency molested
residents at the Epe home of the governor. “It is also
not true that the search, was an attempt to plant foreign currencies in the
home of the former governor” EFCC said.
