 The
prominent pro-democracy and civil rights advocacy group – Human Rights Writers
Association Of Nigeria (HURIWA) has warned of the dire consequences of the president
Muhammadu Buhari’s consistent misuse of his powers to use the armed security
forces to emasculate civil rights of Nigerians. The
Rights group stated this in a statement by the National Coordinator Comrade
Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss. Zainab Yusuf
issued against the backdrop of the reported attacks by armed security forces in
Lagos targeting participants at a town hall meeting titled #RevolutionNow in
which the likes of the Nobel prize for  literature  winner Professor
Wole Soyinka and civil Rights leader Femi Falana (SAN) amongst a plethora of
other Nigerians were disallowed from holding the scheduled peaceful assemble of
pro-human rights advocates. “The
danger in allowing the continuous deployment of military force to stop peaceful
and constructive civic engagements is that constitutional democracy may
collapse under the heavyweight of authoritarianism and the consequences will be
huge to such a level that it could result in Nigeria becoming a massively
 failed state,” HURIWA submitted. The
Rights group has therefore demanded the release unconditionally of all those
arrested in connection with any form of non-violent civic engagements because
of the exercise of their fundamental freedoms enshrined in chapter four of the
1999 constitution which absolutely do not constitute any treason but indeed
what is treasonable and obnoxious is the persistent and illegal use of security
forces by government to crush civil rights actions by Nigerians which in some
cases have resulted in arbitrary mass arrests and illegal detention. HURIWA 
cited section 39(1) “Every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression,
including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and
information without interference.” Section
40 “Every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other
persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade
union or any other association for the protection of his interests: Provided
that the provisions of this section shall not derogate from the powers
conferred by this Constitution on the Independent National Electoral Commission
with respect to political parties to which that Commission does not accord
recognition.” Section
41(1) “Every citizen of Nigeria is entitled to move freely throughout Nigeria
and to reside in any part thereof, and no citizen of Nigeria shall be expelled
from Nigeria or refused entry thereby or exit therefrom.” Section
42 (1)(2) “A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community, ethnic group, place
of origin, sex, religion or political opinion shall not, by reason only that he
is such a person:- (a) be subjected either expressly by, or in the practical
application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any executive or administrative
action of the government, to disabilities or restrictions to which citizens of
Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religions
or political opinions are not made subject; or (b) be accorded either expressly
by, or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any such
executive or administrative action, any privilege or advantage that is not
accorded to citizens of Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups, places of
origin, sex, religions or political opinions.” “No
citizen of Nigeria shall be subjected to any disability or deprivation merely
by reason of the circumstances of his birth.” HURIWA also stated that the
actions of the security forces are in clear violations of the aforementioned
constitutional provisions and that the government is replacing constitutional
democracy with an authoritarian police state. HURIWA 
recalled that  Police, Nigerian Army and Department of State Services
(DSS) operatives on Monday
sealed off the venue of a symposium where Nobel laureate, Professor Wole
Soyinka, rights lawyer, Femi Falana SAN, and other speakers were to speak on
the insecurity situation in Nigeria. HURIWA 
recalled that the Police vehicles were positioned around the venue located at
46 Ibijoke street, Oluyole bus-stop, Oregun, Lagos. HURIWA
quoting the conveners in a report stated that the programme tagged “Democracy,
State Repression and the State of insecurity in Nigeria”, was organised by
Coalition for Revolution (CORE) just as HURIWA recalled that CORE,
a group led by the detained 2019 presidential candidate of the African Action
Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, and its allies, recently vowed to resume
protests demanding revolution in Nigeria.
