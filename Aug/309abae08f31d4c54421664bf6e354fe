#TrackNigeria –As
part of efforts to make Nigeria a net exporter of refined petroleum products,
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), is working out modalities
to partner with the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSChE) to build
condensate refineries. The Group Managing
Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, dropped the hint when he received the
national executives of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSChE) led
by its President, Engr. Onochie Anyaoku, at the NNPC Towers, Abuja. Mallam Kyari said the
corporation was willing to tap from the abundant expertise and experiences of
the Chemical Society in order to ramp up the refining capacity of the country. “We will keep the
flag flying and take the NNPC to the next level by delivering value to the
Nigerian people. The NNPC Group is willing and ready to work with NSChE to
ensure that the corporation remains a going concern. We look forward to every
support that we can get from you,” the GMD stated. He assured that the
NNPC would collaborate with the Society to build skilled workforce, for the
corporation and the entire country through capacity building workshops and
seminars. Earlier, the NSChE
President, Engr. Anyaoku, congratulated Mallam Kyari on his appointment and
assured him and his management of the Society’s support to confront the
enormous challenges facing the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry. “It is therefore
appropriate, that we seek ways to support your group not just to heighten
awareness of numerous NNPC’s achievements, but also to find a suitable
framework to leverage your efforts,” Engr. Anyaoku said.
