#TrackNigeria: The Nigerian Air Force, NAF says its Air Task Force, ATF of
Operation Lafiya Dole, on Friday, neutralised several Islamic State of West
Africa Province, ISWAP, fighters at multiple locations within Kollaram, in
Borno. Kollaram is a settlement on the fringes of Lake Chad in the
Northern part of Borno. NAF’s spokesperson, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who disclosed
this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said the operation was conducted on
Friday. “The operation, which was conducted on August 9 as part
of the ongoing Operation Green Sweep 3  targeted three  compounds in
the village, where Human Intelligence, HUMINT, reports had earlier indicated
that the ISWAP fighters were concentrated. “Consequently, confirmatory Intelligence Surveillance and
Reconnaissance, ISR, missions showed significant presence of the terrorists in
the designated areas. ”The ATF scrambled three Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the
locations. ”The munitions of the Jets hit the desired points of impact
of the targets causing damage to the buildings and neutralising dozens of the
terrorists,” he said. Mr Daramola said the NAF, operating in concert with surface
forces, would sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists
in the North-East. NAN
