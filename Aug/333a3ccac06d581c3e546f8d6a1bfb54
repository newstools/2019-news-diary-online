Chelsea threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with newly promoted Sheffield United on Saturday, leaving manager Frank Lampard still looking for his first home win. Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham got his name on the score-sheet at Stamford Bridge for the first time with two first-half goals. Abraham, one of several players from Chelsea’s youth academy given a chance by Lampard, slotted home in the 19th minute when Sheffield keeper Dean Henderson failed to gather the ball under pressure from Christian Pulisic. Abraham doubled Chelsea’s lead in the 43rd minute when he capitalised on a defensive mix-up. But the visitors pulled a goal back immediately after half-time when Callum Robinson converted a cross from Enda Stevens and equalised in the 89th minute when Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma netted past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
