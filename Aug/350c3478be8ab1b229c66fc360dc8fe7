By Tina George, Minna Some past commissioners and permanent secretaries in Niger state are
fingered to be involved in illegal auctioning of government vehicles at the
tail end of the first tenure of governor Abubakar Sani-Bello. Five of these past commissioners and permanent secretaries were said to
have sold the vehicles to themselves and family members at give away
prices. Our reporter gathered that they acted without following due process or
involving the transport officer or store keepers in the auctioning, which was
said to have taken place on the eve of the second tenure of Sani Bello. The illegal auctioning was brought to the open when a group of civil
servants who call themselves ‘Concerned Staff’, petitioned the state government
about the incident. A copy of the letter obtained by our reporter written by “Concern
Staff of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism”, alleged that the
Commissioner and the Permanent Secretary (name withheld) connived and auctioned
to themselves, two Hilux vans belonging to the ministry. The petition said the two Hilux vans were tagged to be
“unserviceable” and auctioned at the rate of N350,000 each, adding
that the auctioning was in complete disregard to procedures for auctioning of
government properties. The staffs alleged that the “unserviceable” vehicles were the
only useable utility vehicles belonging to the ministry, adding that they
“were in sound, health, effective and serviceable condition” as the
vehicles had been recently undergone total maintenance. The acting Head of Service, Mallam Shuaibu Adamu Suleja, who confirmed
the receipt of the petition, said the state government had set up the
investigation committee to look into the allegations.
