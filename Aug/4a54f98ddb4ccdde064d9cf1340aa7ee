The National Broadcasting Commission
will hold its 5th Annual lecture at the Congress Hall of Transcorp Hilton
Hotel, Abuja, on Tuesday, August 27th, 2019 by 10am. A statement  by the Management said the lecture, which is
in furtherance of the Commission’s resolve to raise consciousness and encourage
broadcasters to be more responsible and responsive to the trends and
development in the industry, was designed to bring together stakeholders within
and outside the broadcasting industry for meaningful, mutually beneficial
intellectual interaction. Professor  Ahmed Adam, Dean, Post Graduate Studies,
Nigerian Defence Academy, will present the Keynote address with the
theme:“Contemporary Challenges of the Nigerian State: Need for Constructive
Broadcasting.” The lecture was first held in 2015,
with the theme: “New Media Convergence and the Future of Broadcasting: Greedy
Telco, Naïve Broadcasters and the Scramble for Spectrum”. This was presented by
Mr. Shola Taylor. In 2016, Prof. Attahiru Jega spoke
on, “Broadcasting and the Challenges of the New Nigeria”, while the 3rd edition
had the theme: “On Cosmopolitanism: Nigeria Ethnic Politics and the
Communication of Hate”. The 4th edition with the theme:
“Broadcasting and Nigeria’s Ethno-Cultural and Religious Divide: Bridging the
Gap”, was presented by Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari. This year’s edition will, among others,
focus on the urgent need to collectively make concerted efforts towards
ensuring peaceful coexistence amongst the divergent interest groups in Nigeria,
using the instrumentality of the broadcast media. The National Broadcasting Commission
was established by an Act of the National Assembly signed into Law on August
24, 1992 heralding the deregulation of the broadcasting industry in Nigeria.
The lecture was instituted by the Management of the Commission to mark the
Commission’s Anniversary. Discussants are veteran broadcasters
and security experts, as well as key professionals.
