Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal has stressed the need for butchers in the State to follow the global best practice in the production and handling of meat for public consumption. The Commissioner who gave the charge today in his Office when he received in audience a delegation of the Lagos State Butchers Association noted that the charge became imperative in view of the fact that the State has always been known for quality and global best practices hence the need for butchers in the State to follow suit. He noted that the Government would soon revisit the type of vehicles being used by butchers to transport meat across the State noting that the current situation is unwholesome and therefore not acceptable. The Commissioner expressed concern about various issues including reduction in the quality and quantity of Cattle supply to the State due to various reasons and the funding of the butchers by Banks amongst others. While promising to look into ways of assisting the Association through various empowerment programmes, Prince Lawal advocated for a meeting with the Association later in the week to discuss and come up with short and long term solutions to the various problems. The Lagos State Butchers Association which was led by its Chairman, Mr. Bamidele Kazeem, expressed its appreciation to the Commissioner for receiving them despite his busy schedule and promised to cooperate with the State Government to ensure that the meat consumed by the public is wholesome.
