#TrackNigeria The Tribunal, sitting at the Kaduna State High Court, on Saturday threw out the petition by Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Lawal Adamu Usman (Mr LA), challenging the declared victory of Uba Sani in the February senatorial election for Kaduna Central. By this judgement, the Kaduna State National and State Assemblies Election Petitions Tribunal has validated the victory of Senator Uba Sani as the bonafide representative of Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone at the Senate. Delivering the judgment, Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice A.H Suleiman, said the petition argued by Mr LAâ€™s lawyers could not be sustained on the strength of the evidences adduced. Justice Suleiman while throwing out the petition said the bulk of the evidences presented by Mr LA hinged on hearsay which is not admissible in Law. A couple of days earlier, the Tribunal had struck out a similar petition against Uba Sani by ex-Senator Shehu Sani for lack of merit. The Tribunal rejected as invalid all evidences tendered by the petitioner. The petitioner also failed to prove any of his allegations of Corrupt Practices, over votings and election violence. The court upheld that all his witnesses depositions were of hearsay.
