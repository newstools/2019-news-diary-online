By Tina George, Minna The Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Nigeria has appealed to Federal government to scrap the conduct of elections and examinations on Saturdays because it is their Sabbath day. The President, Northern Nigeria Union Conference of the Church, Pastor Yohanna Harry observed that conducting elections and examinations on these days, was denying their members the civic right to worship. Speaking to newsmen in Minna after its North Central Nigeria Men Conference at Brighter International School, Harry said government needed to put members of the Church into consideration and stop disenfranchising them. “Nigerians have the freedom of worship, they are supposed to be free to worship the way they want. It has become a thing of concern to our members to worship as our day of Sabbath is usually the day in which political elections are fixed. “Also examinations are also fixed during these days and our students suffer so much because of their inability to worship God due to the fact that they write examinations on these days. “Considering the contribution of the church to the economy, the government should listen to our plea and conduct elections and examinations on other days apart from Saturdays. “The government have to understand our philosophy and grant us free worship on Saturday. We are being disenfranchised because we have the right to worship on any day and government needs to respect that and give us our right,” Harry said. Speaking about the Men Conference, he said it was aimed at upgrading the spiritual, intellectual, financial and physical abilities of the men in the church. He said over 500 men were attending the conference, which would end on Sunday.
