A
total of 73 households and ‎28 shops were set ablaze by Boko Haram insurgents
in three villages of Konduga local government area following Thursday night’s
attack, the state emergency management agency (SEMA) confirmed to Borno
Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum on Saturday. The
Governor undertook an impact assessment visit to affected villages in Konduga.
He returned to Maiduguri on Friday night, few hours after one-on-one security
meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa. In
Borri, one of the three villages torched by the insurgents, Professor Zulum was
informed by chairman of SEMA, Hajiya Yabawa Kolo that around 8pm of August 22,
the insurgents attacked and set ablaze 17 households and 4 shops in Borri and
in Wanori village, 34 households and 18 shops were also set ablaze while 22
households and 6 shops were torched in Kaleri-Abdule village. The figures added
up to 73 households and 28 shops, the agency’s boss said. The
Governor went round to see things before meeting residents and community
leaders affected ‎by the attack. Professor
Zulum promised immediate reconstruction of homes. Modern houses will replace
those destroyed, he said. More important, the Governor said, were the
assurances from President Buhari previous day with respect to concerted efforts
by the federal government to enhance security in Borno State. Governor
Zulum also held discussions with youth volunteers under the Civilian JTF who
help with community policing. The volunteers told the Governor they were short
of patrol vehicles and the Governor immediately offered them two brand new
patrol vehicles. Professor
Zulum was accompanied by top government officials who include stakeholders from
the affected villages in Konduga.
