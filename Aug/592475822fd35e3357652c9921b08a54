President Buhari Monday
presided over the opening day of a Presidential Retreat for Ministers-designate
and senior Government officials. The Retreat follows the
screening and confirmation of the Ministers-designate by the National Assembly,
and holds ahead of their swearing-in by the President on Wednesday, August 21, 2019, at the State House. In the first technical
presentation of the Retreat, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo delivered an overview
of the work of the Policies, Programmes and Projects Audit Committee (PPPAC),
established by President Buhari in March 2019 and chaired by the Vice
President, with a mandate to review the performance in the first term and
outline a Roadmap for the new Administration. This was followed by
presentations on National Security, Economic Development and Anti-Corruption
Agenda, after which participants engaged in eleven Breakout sessions to
deliberate on issues across the priority policy areas of the Administration. These sessions covered
Security; Macroeconomic Stability; Agriculture and Food Security; Energy
Security in petroleum products and electricity; Transportation and Critical
Infrastructure; Industrialisation and SME Development; Human Capital
Development; Social Inclusion; Anti-Corruption; and Housing Financing and
Consumer Credit. Declaring the Retreat open,
President Buhari charged the incoming Ministers to ensure that all hands were
on deck to realise the Administrationâ€™s vision of laying the grounds for the
lifting of 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. The President also asked
them to take seriously their responsibility to develop and implement policies,
programmes and projects, and harped on the importance of working as a team and
communicating amongst themselves and with the Nigerian people. The two-day Presidential
Retreat ends on Tuesday.
