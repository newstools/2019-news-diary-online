The Governor Henry Seriake Dickson-led Restoration Group has swept the
national delegates’ election of the Peoples Democratic Party in all the eight
local Government Areas òf Bayelsa State. The Restoration Team had earlier floored the Timi Alaibe Campaign
Organisation and other non Restoration aspirants of the party in three-man Ward
Delegates Congress organized by the Governor òf Ebonyi State, Chief Dave Umahi,
on Saturday. The Ward delegates who were elected on Saturday participated alongside
other stakeholders to elect the national delegates of the party in the election
organized by the Deputy Governor òf Abia State,  Dr. Ude Oko Chukwu, the
Bayelsa State National Delegates Returning Officer Monday. All the ward delegates assembled at the respective local government
headquarters to join other stakeholders of the party to elect the national
delegates from the local government areas. A critical analysis of the list showed that over 90 per cent of the names
that emerged from the election were members of the Restoration Caucus. The outcome of the election of the national delegates, according to
observers,  is a further reinforcement of the dominance of the
Restoration Group on the politics of the PDP and Bayelsa.
