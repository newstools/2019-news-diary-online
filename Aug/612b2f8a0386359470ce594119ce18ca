#TrackNigeria: Women of Purpose Development Foundation, an NGO, has called on the Federal government to adequately set up policies that would guarantee women’s right to affirmative action to encourage women participation in politics in the country. Mrs Mabel Onwuemele, the founder of the group made the call in an interview during a town hall meeting to commemorate World Humanitarian Day Celebration in Abuja on Monday. According to her, the theme of the town hall meeting titled ” celebrating Women Humanitarians” is aimed at addressing the role of women in humanitarian work for the development of the country. Onwuemele said adequate implementation of 35 per cent affirmative action for women would foster positive governance, calling on the FG to address the discrimination against women in the country. “Women are powerful and natural, whatever you put in a woman’s hand she doubles it, so it is expected that women will be more valuable in humanitarian work than men. “It is a clarion call to the government to include more women in political appointment or in the cabinet because women are much more organised and detailed than men. “Women have been left behind, treated as second class citizens and during elections they come out with their kids to vote after which they are not found in the cabinet. “I call on the Federal Government to have more women inclusiveness in the cabinet to record adequate progress in governance in the country,” she said. The founder maintained that the resistance to women based affirmative action has remained the enabling tool for perpetuation of discrimination against women in the country. (NAN)
