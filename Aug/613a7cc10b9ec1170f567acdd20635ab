The
proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group has had nothing to do with
President Muhammadu Buhari since he arrived Yokohama, Japan, on Monday, the
Presidency has said. Presidential
Spokesman, Femi Adesina who stated this in a press release equally  urged Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora “to
disregard concocted stories, backed with spurious visuals, of any protest
or harassment of the President and his team.” Adesina
said “It is the stock-in-trade of hate mongers, who do not realize that the
rest of Nigerians have left them far behind.” According
to the Presidential Spokesman, “President Buhari will make his presence at the
Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) count
for Nigeria, and no scare-mongering or sabre-rattling will detract from the
outing.”
