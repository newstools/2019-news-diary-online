#TrackNigeria: Worried by the increasing security challenges in the country, the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Anambra Chapter, on Friday expressed willingness to partner with security agencies to stem the rising insecurity in the state. The State Chairman, NYCN, Mr Samuel Egwuatu, made the pledge at a youth security summit organised by the council in collaboration with Directorate of Security Service (DSS) and other security agencies in Awka. The Summit had the theme, “Securing Lives and Property: The Role of Youth Leaders for Sustainable Security in Anambra”. “Security is about life and property and it requires pragmatic approach. “Like the saying, the youth are the security of any nation. Also, about 60 per cent of our security personnel are youths. Which means we have a critical role to play in ensuring stability in our state and country. “This is why we are holding this submit with security stakeholders to brainstorm and proffer solutions that will make us enjoy sustainable peace in the state,” he said. Also, Mr Afam Mbanefo, State Commissioner for Youth Entrepreneurship and Creative Economy, said that ensuring safety of lives and property was the major priority of the Gov. Willie Obiano led-administration. “Security is prime to this administration. With security, we can attract more investors to boost our economy and Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). “The youth can assist security agents with information gathering to make Anambra the most secured state in the country,” he said. In his keynote address, retired Air Vice-Marshal Ben Chiobi, lamented that the underused resources that could address security problems in the country were the youth. “In spite of government’s huge budgetary allocation to security, our insecurity challenges remain unresolved. “Nigeria is a country with large youth population, and if funds go to youth empowerment or even engaging them at the decision making level, they can be change agents in our society. “We have high rates of crime today because our youth are not duly recognised and empowered. “Youths as tomorrow’s leaders have much to offer in advancing peace and changing the society while they are still young,” Chiobi said.
