conference to establish areas of cooperation that can benefit Borno State. The spokesman recalled that Borno State has benefited from some
Japanese funded interventions which include an intervention on livelihood
support through the UN’s World Food Programme launched in March, 2019; an
intervention on agriculture for villagers in Kaga local government launched in
September 2016 and a rural electrification project executed through a Japanese
