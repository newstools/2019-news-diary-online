delivered by Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation,
President Buhari notes that the loss of such a lively young man at this time
could not but cause immense grief to all who knew him. “This is a great loss. Imran was such a brilliant young man.
Full of life, with a lot of promise, he had consistently distinguished himself
wherever he was found. He shone in the schools he went, won many Letters of
Commendation, and was a friend to all.  His generation has lost a shining
star,” the President said. According to a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President

the loss,  especially strengthen the siblings who looked up to him for
inspiration and also comfort colleagues at the Nigerian Shippers’ Council where
he worked.
