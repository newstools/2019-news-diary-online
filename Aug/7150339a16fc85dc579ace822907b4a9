Three final year law students of
Ahmadu Bello University Zaria have been abducted by kidnappers on the notorious
Kaduna-Abuja Expressway on Tuesday afternoon.

A source disclosed to PRNigeria that the names of the undergraduates are Fatima
from Taraba, Maryam from Niger and Umar from Katsina States respectively. 

The source said: “The three abducted students are all 500-Level law
students of ABU Zaria. We learnt that the kidnappers initially demanded for
N50m ransom each but later reduced to N5m because they are students who are yet
to be working.”

A passenger who escaped during the encounter with the kidnappers told PRNigeria
that the abductors attacked commercial vehicles and big trucks.

“I am surprised that unlike their previous antics of attacking rich and
big people  in exotic cars, the kidnappers now attack commercial vehicles,
trucks and buses and abducted their poor drivers and passengers.

“I shed tears when I noticed corpses of some victims littered on the road
after the brutal abduction incident.

“Some top public functionaries with  armed convoy who came later
refused to stop when crying women sought for help and protection.”

There are fears that the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) spearheaded by
DCP Abba Kyari has not been very active lately since killing of some of their
operatives in an encounter with soldiers at Ibbi  in Taraba State.
