#TrackNigeria The Head of Service of the Federal, Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, on Monday, reportedly submitted a retirement letter from the civil service to President Muhammadu Buhari, according to TheCable. The head of service is reportedly under pressure by family members to vacate office after information that she was being probed over an alleged contract scam amounting to N3 billion. Since the probe went public, Oyo- Ita has consistently denied her involvement in any scam. However, she finally submitted to family pressures and sent in her resignation letter on Sunday. “Mrs Oyo-Ita has sent in her letter of retirement,” said a family member. It has been previously alleged that the probe was borne out of a misunderstanding with Abba Kyari and severs as a punishment but Oyo –Ita has vehemently refuted the insinuations. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recently questioned Oyo-Ita over allegations that she used front companies to get contracts when she was a permanent secretary before her appointment as head of service by Buhari in 2015. Prior to her invitation by the anti-graft agency, reportedly, the sum of N600 million was traced to the account of one of her aides, who has been interrogated by the EFCC, and released. Oyo-Ita has refuted allegation to defraud the state of the money as she was claimed the money was meant for death benefits of staff, originally meant to be kept in a designated account for that purpose by the project accountant. The president is yet to take a final decision on the resignation letter. Credit: TheCable
