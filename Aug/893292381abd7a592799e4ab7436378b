#TrackNigeria — Nigeria has reaffirmed its unwavering
commitment to production adjustments agreed upon under the Declaration of
Cooperation (DoC) between member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Non-OPEC Countries at the last Ministerial
Meeting of what is known as OPEC Plus, held on July 2, 2019, Vienna, Austria. Nigeria’s Representatives on the OPEC Economic Commission Board
and Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC),
Mallam Mele Kyari, made this known in a statement issued Wednesday in Abuja. According to the statement signed by the OPEC Representative,
Nigeria is totally committed to full compliance with the agreement reached by
the parties to the DoC. “Right now we are not only committed to the agreement but we
have elevated our attitude towards it to the point of complete devotion to the
adjustments and we urge other parties to follow suit,” the OPEC Rep
stated. Kyari expressed strong optimism that the momentary and
artificially induced bearish trends would naturally correct itself based on the
strong market fundamentals which have remained steadfast despite the price
slid. He enthused that with a visible steady decline in commercial
stock overhang propelled by healthy demand, it is only logical for all
advocates of oil price stability like the OPEC Plus allies to comply strictly
with the agreed production adjustments. He concluded that with the increasing volatility of the oil market,
it has become commonsensical for Nigeria and all other parties to the agreement
to entrench an attitude of unwavering devotion to the deal anchored on full and
timely conformity to their obligations.
