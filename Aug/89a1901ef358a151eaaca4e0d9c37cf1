By heeding the Federal Government’s
call on Nigerian and multi-national oil and gas companies to relocate their
operational headquarters to the Niger Delta, BelemaOil Producing Ltd has set a
great example worth emulating, the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie
Omo-Agege has said. In a letter of commendation
addressed to the company, Senator Omo-Agege, who has been championing the call
for such relocation in view of the restored peace in the Niger Delta,
emphasized that oil and gas companies’ relocation is not only a demonstration
of faith in government and the host communities but a way to foster financial
inclusion for all stakeholders at the grassroots. “I write to commend the board,
management and staff of your company for conscientiously heeding the
presidential initiative advising oil and gas exploration companies in Nigeria
to move their headquarters to their operational base. “The Federal Government’s policy
initiatives, including the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan as well as our
‘Next Level’ political thrust all place emphasis on social and economic
inclusion which your company’s relocation can further facilitate among its
thirty-eight host communities. “Your relocation will not only
foster a productive engagement strategy for mutual wealth creation, it would go
a long way towards engendering trust between operator and host communities
while also helping to sustain peace. “Indeed, many feel impressed that
since 2013 when you acquired the entire 40% participating interest in OML- 55
in a competitive bidding process to become the operator of the OML- 55 asset in
the Joint Venture between Belemaoil Producing Limited and Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), your company’s has striven to demonstrate a clear
understanding of what Corporate Social Responsibility means. “While commending you for relocating
you company headquarters to your operational base, I urge you to sustain the
adroit management of your host communities’ interests and high expectations
through a process of direct engagement/open communication and community
development as reflected in your current youth employment, young graduates’
training scheme, scholarship awards and infrastructural development schemes,”
the Deputy Senate President stated.
