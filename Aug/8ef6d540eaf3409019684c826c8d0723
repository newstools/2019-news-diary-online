Anti-government protesters in Hong Kong were set to clash
with police for the tenth consecutive weekend on Saturday as residents planned
to return to the streets despite a ban. Marches were planned for Tai Po district in the New
Territories at 3 pm (0700 GMT) and later in Wong Tai Sin in Kowloon. Hong Kong police have denied protesters a letter of “no
objection,” meaning that the demonstrations this weekend are not considered to
be legal assemblies. Both locations have been the site of intense police-protester
clashes in recent weeks. Protesters were also due to return to Hong Kong
International Airport, where scores are staging a three-day sit-in to attract
international attention to their cause. Protests began in Hong Kong on June 9 against a
controversial legislative bill that would have allowed for the extradition of
suspected criminals to mainland China. Since then protesters have expanded their demands to include
an independent commission into police brutality and for universal suffrage in
the election of the city’s leadership. The city’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has however
refused to make any concessions to protesters although she has declared the
bill suspended, but not fully withdrawn as protesters demand. (dpa/NAN)
