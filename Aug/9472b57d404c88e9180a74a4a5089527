The Inspector General of Police
(IGP), Mr Mohammed Adamu, has ordered the deployment of aerial surveillance
helicopters to major cities in the South-West and North-West of the country. The Force Public Relations Officer
(FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Thursday in Abuja said the order was
part of efforts by the police to effectively curtail crimes in the country. He said that the Police Air-Wing
Operational Base in Abuja would cater for Abujaâ€“Kaduna highways and the
adjoining states in the North-West and North-Central. Mba said that the new base in Ondo
would cater for the adjoining states and highways straddling the South-West. He enjoined Nigerians not to panic
and go about their lawful businesses, adding that the aerial surveillance was
to improve the security of lives and property in the affected areas. (NAN)
