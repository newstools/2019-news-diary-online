The Abia State Commissioner of
Police, Mr Ene Okon, has said that the alleged killer soldier, Private Ajayi
Johnson, would be arraigned before Friday. The police boss made the disclosure
in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Aba on Tuesday. Okon said the police may have him
arraigned in court before concluding investigations or after the conclusion of
investigations into the matter. He said the soldier was only handed
over to the police on Thursday, urging the media to be patient and await the
date of his arraignment. “I am sure that within the week, he
will be in court; It may be tomorrow or next tomorrow. “When he was handed over to the
police, we made it known to the media and when he would be arraigned, we would
let the media know that we have taken him to court,” said Okon. NAN reports that Johnson was alleged
to have shot dead Chimaobi Nwoha, a motorcyclist, on Aug. 7, in his home town
of Umuokereke Ngwa in Obingwa LGA for failing to give him a N100 bribe. After the dastardly act, the soldier
was arrested days later, after which the military authorities tried and found
him guilty of failing to abide by military rules. Brig.-Gen. Solomon Kumapayi,
Commander, Nigerian Army 14 Brigade in Ohafia, subsequently announced that
Johnson, serving at Ohanze Forward Operation Base (FOB), had been demoted from
a Lance Corporal to a Private and dismissed. He was later handed over to the
police on Thursday for prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction. (NAN)
