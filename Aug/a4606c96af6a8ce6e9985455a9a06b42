The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Yola on Thursday
dismissed the suit challenging the emergence of Cliff Abbo as the senator
representing Adamawa North Senatorial District. The suit was filed by Sen. Binta Masi of All Progressives
Congress (APC) who lost the seat to Abbo during the general election. Delivering judgment, the Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice
Sulaiman Akanbi, said that the petitioner could not provide any credible
evidence to show that the election of Abbo was marred by over voting and other
irregularities as alleged. “All said and done, the petitioner failed to prove his petition
with convincing evidence. We consequently dismissed this petition,’’ the judge
ruled. Reacting, counsel to Massi, Mr Yakubu Bello, said that his
client would appeal the judgment. On his part, Sen. Abbo said that he was excited by the victory
and urged Massi to accept the outcome in good faith. Abbo said that the case had been one of the major things
distracting him and that he would now have time to work for his people. “My people should be expecting wonders. I am not a mistake and I
will make them proud,” Abbo said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the election tribunal
had also dismissed the case filed by Sen. Ahmad Mo-Allahyidi of APC challenging
