#TrackNigeria The National and State Houses of Assembly Petition Tribunal sitting in Lafia, on Friday struck out a petition challenging the March 9, 2019, election which returned Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Candidate, Mr Ibrahim Akwe for Obi 1 Constituency. The Candidate of  the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Isa Mohammed,  challenged the victory of Akwe in the State House of Assembly election. The APC candidate alleged electoral malpractice and non-compliance with Electoral Act. Reading the unanimous judgment of the tribunal, the Chairman, Justice David Ugoh, said that the petitioner failed to prove that Akwe did not score the highest number of lawful votes cast in the election. The chairman added that the petitioner failed to prove non-compliance with the Electoral Act and how malpractice was carried out. Ugoh said that the petition was lacking in merit, noting that the burden of proof lied with the petitioner. “Since he failed to prove that, we, therefore, hold that the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is valid.” (NAN)
