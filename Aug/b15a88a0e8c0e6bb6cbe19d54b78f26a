 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has denied reports that its operatives have raided the residence of former Governor of Lagos State, Akinwumi Amber. Acting spokesman of EFCC, Tony Orilade disclosed in a statement that the commission has  since the early hours of today(Tuesday) been inundated with calls that operatives of the Commission raided the residence of the forlrmer governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode. He declared,”We need to state for the records that the EFCC did not raid Ambode’s house. It is instructive that his administration, like other former governors is under investigation, since they no longer constitutionally enjoy immunity against prosecution. “The Commission hereby states with high sense of responsibility that the operatives did not raid Ambode’s residence. He however hinted that “whatever the Commission is presently doing with regards to the investigation is in line with its mandate and the rule of law. “We wish to inform the social media to be circumspect in the reportage of any news with regards to investigation activities of the Commission. He added that “as a tradition, the Commission does not carry out investigation on the pages of the newspapers or through the media. Our operations are always covert until at a time when we file charges in court. “Therefore, the attempt to cast the Commission in a bad light is unacceptable as the EFCC will never engage in illegal act. We remain committed to the war against corruption.”
