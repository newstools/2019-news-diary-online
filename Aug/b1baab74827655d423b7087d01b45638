 All Progressives Congress (APC) National Stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has congratulated all Muslim faithful across the country and the world on the occasion of the celebration of Eid ul-Adha, urging Nigerians to be ready to make sacrifice for the development of the country in the spirit of the festival. The former Lagos State governor also prayed for the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that the President’s APC-led government has set the country on an irreversible path towards a broad and inclusive political, social and economic development for the benefit of all Nigerians. In a statement released by his Media Office on Saturday in Lagos and signed by Tunde Rahman, Asiwaju Tinubu said:  “To mark the Eid ul-Adha faithfully, we must abide by what it embodies-sacrifice and selflessness-. It is a time for celebration but we must celebrate in the spirit of submission to the will of Allah exemplified by Prophet Ibrahim’s rare example. “Like Prophet Ibrahim, let us be ready to make sacrifices for the well being of Nigerians and development of the country”. While observing that Eid ul-Adha should be a day of joy and happiness, Asiwaju Tinubu counselled all Muslims, indeed all Nigerians of faith, to show tenderness and love to fellow Nigerians, their friends and neighbours, remarking that “as we devote ourselves to the will of God, so too should we be devoted to the health and well-being of our fellow man. “May the joy of Eid ul-Adha be multiplied many folds in our lives and the life of our great nation. May the blessings of Almighty Allah be with us all forever.”
