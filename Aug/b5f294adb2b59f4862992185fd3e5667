#TrackNigeria: The Police Command in Anambra said on Wednesday it had arrested four suspects, including a chairman of market association it alleged were behind recent cult-related killings in the state. The spokesman for the command, SP Haruna Mohammed, who made the disclosure in Awka, said the suspects were arrested by a team led by the Police Commissioner in charge of the state, Mr John Abang. He recalled that on Aug. 10 and Aug. 11, two rival cult groups, Black Axe and Vikings Confraternities, clashed at Dike Park near Eke Awka in Awka South area of the state. The incident, according to Mohammed, claimed the life of two persons. He explained that following the incident, the command’s “Operation Puff-Adder’’ led by the commissioner launched a manhunt for the suspects. Mohammed said that the suspects were caught at Dike Park and Umukwa village, leading to the arrest of the four suspected “sponsors/members of Black Axe and Vikings confraternities’’.
