The Buhari Media
Organisation (BMO) has applauded the Federal Government for the suspension of
the Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public
Property, Chief Okoi Obono-Obla over allegations related to official misconduct
and abuse of office. In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy, BMO
recalled that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had persistently
accused the President Muhammadu Buhari administration of shielding members of
the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from prosecution over
corruption-related matters, “We make bold to say that with the latest drastic action against a
founding member of the ruling party and a top government official, Chief Obono-Obla,
the Buhari administration has shown that it has no sacred cows in the fight
against corruption, and its resolve to eradicate the scourge remains strong and
unshakeable. “We believe that
this singular action, and the unfolding probe of the current Head of Service,
Mrs Winifred Ekanem Oyo-Ita will lay to rest all doubts about the unfounded
claims by the opposition that the Buhari administration was shielding its
officials from prosecution.  We also believe that the Federal Government’s
decision to suspend him is in order as investigations will unravel any areas of
misconduct on the part of Chief Obla”. BMO said further that
based on the Federal Government’s commitment to rule of law, due process and
transparency, there was need to suspend Obla from office in order to preserve
the integrity of the anti-corruption war and save it from being tainted with a
bad image.
“We hope that the latest moves by the Federal Government should serve as a
warning signal to all government officials that there will be no sacred cows in
the fight against corruption as the Buhari administration remains committed to
tackling the menace head-long as an aggressive problem requires a drastic
solution”, the statement added.
