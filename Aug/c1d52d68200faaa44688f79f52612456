A
Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court sitting in Nyanya, Abuja, presided
over by Hon. Justice Muawiyah Baba Idris, has granted the Independent Corrupt
Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), a final forfeiture
order on a property worth N209 million belonging to a staff of the Budget
Office of the Federation. The
property, a shopping mall, known as Jerijo Plaza and Event Centre, located at
No. 6 Muham Street, Off Abacha Road, Karu, Nasarawa State, is believed to have
been acquired by Mr. Henry Ilemona Oyibo with the proceeds of crime. Mr.
Oyibo’s travails started when ICPC profiled him as a result of investigation
into another matter. Further investigation revealed that he could not have
acquired the property from his legitimate income. This necessitated an
application for an order of interim forfeiture which was granted by the same
court on the property on 17th October, 2018. The
court then adjourned the matter to 5th November, 2018 for ‘’interested
persons to show cause why the property should not be finally forfeited to the
Federal Government of Nigeria’’. Following
a newspaper publication by ICPC, ‘interested persons’ including the respondent
and his brother, Raymond Oyibo  ‘showed cause’, but this was countered by
the Commission in an affidavit stating that the respondents had not shown ‘good
cause’ for the court to vacate the interim forfeiture order, and the matter was
again adjourned to 18th June, 2019. On the adjourned date, Hon. Idris found no merit in the separate affidavits of the respondents and consequently ruled for a final forfeiture of the property to the Federal Government. Following the final forfeiture order by the court, the stage has been set for the prosecution of Mr. Oyibo. #TrackNigeria
