The African Bar Association has announced a postponement of
its 2019 Annual conference which was earlier scheduled to hold at the Triumph
Luxury Hotel, Cairo, Egypt from 2nd to 5th September
2019. The postponement was occasioned by the unco-operative
attitude of the Egyptian government. The inexplicable denial of entry visas to
over 80% of the participants across the continent, including prominent bar
leaders and lawyers has unfortunately led to the decision by the organizers to
postpone the event. However, Cairo’s loss is now Monrovia’s gain. The National
Bar Association  of Liberia  will be hosting the 2019 African Bar  Association Conference with the support of
the government and people of Liberia.The conference is rescheduled to hold
between 20th and 25th October, 2019. President Weah is billed to declare the conference open on 21st
October 2019 with over 10,000 lawyers expected from the various bar
associations and law societies on the continent. Meanwhile top government 
functionaries and business leaders are also expected to grace the event
with the theme: Tackling contemporary issues facing the continent; How lawyers
can drive a renaissance.
