Nigerian Army troops of 26 Task
Force Brigade have successfully thwarted terrorists efforts to plant Improvised
Explosive Device (IED) for commuters and troops’ main supply route in Bitta,
Borno State. Col. Sagir Musa, Acting Director,
Army Public Relations, in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, said the troops
were under the auspices of Operation Halaka Dodo, Theatre Command Operation of Lafiya
Dole. Musa disclosed that the troops laid
an effective night ambush for terrorists in the midst of heavy downpour and
encountered their IED party at Wala crossing point attempting to emplace the
lethal device. He added that the troops responded
swiftly in a fire fight and killed two of the terrorists while others scampered
for their dear lives with likely gun shot wounds under the cover of darkness. According to him, two AK 47 riffles,
three magazines, 32 rounds of 7.62mm special ammunition and four primed IEDs
were recovered from the criminals. “It would be recalled that
earlier in the week, the terrorists suffered heavy losses when they failed in
their attack on the headquarters of 26 Task Force Brigade, Bitta. The attackers were overpowered by
national forces which caused the death of many terrorists and recovery of some
weapons. “Accordingly, the merits of the new
concept of super Camp in the operational arena has already started yielding
results with troops becoming more mobile, agile, robust and unpredictable. “Hence, troops continue to dominate
the Theatre with mobile patrols, ambushes, deliberate attacks and raids thereby
denying the terrorists/criminals freedom of action. “Already, Acting General Officer
Commanding 7 Division and Commander sector 1, Operation Lafiya, Brig. Gen. A.K
Ibrahim has commended the troops for their efforts. “He urged them to sustain the tempo
to completely stamp out all vestiges of the terrorists in the area of
operation,” he said. (NAN)
