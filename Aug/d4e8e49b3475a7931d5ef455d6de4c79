The President of the Senate, Ahmad
Ibrahim Lawan, has felicitated with Nigerians, particularly the Muslim
faithful, as they celebrate this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. The Senate President, in a Sallah
message released on Saturday
by his Media Adviser, Ola Awoniyi, also congratulates all Muslims who have
joined their brothers and sisters from across the world in participating in the
rites of the Hajj in Saudi Arabia. As they mark the very important pious
occasion, Lawan reminds all Muslims to remember the purpose of the celebration,
which is to commemorate the trials and triumph of Prophet Ibrahim. He said the Prophet is remembered and
venerated across ages for passing a great test of faith. The Senate President urges all
Nigerians to be steadfast in their commitment to building the nation of their dream. “I urge all to take inspiration
from the exemplary virtues demonstrated by Prophet Ibrahim through his
sacrifice, patience, steadfastness, generosity and obedience to Allah’s command
and constituted authority,” the statement said, quoting Lawan who is
currently in the Holy Land for this year’s Hajj. Lawan also enjoined Nigerians to always
remember their shared heritage and destiny of national greatness and to be
guided by the Nigerian spirit of firm confidence as they tackle the
contemporary challenges of nation-building. The Senate President wishes all
Nigerians happy Sallah celebrations.
