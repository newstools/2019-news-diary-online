The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, FCT, Hon. Abdullahi Suleimam Sabo, has called on Muslims in the country to imbibe the virtues of tolerance and unity during the Eid-el-Kabir Sallah celebration. Sabo made the call in an interview on Sunday in his Sallah message to the people of Kuje Area Council, to mark the celebration. According to him, the country is in need of prayers, support, dedication, sincerity and patriotic zeal by the citizenry to move the nation to a greater height. “Some teachings by the Prophet were humility, self-less service, welfare of the people, sacrifice, tolerance, peace and stability for all, irrespective of religious backgrounds. “Nigerians should love and tolerate each other, irrespective of religious and political differences for the nation to overcome the security challenges confronting it. “The nation has the human and natural potential to achieve greatness and most Nigerians have excelled in various fields of human endeavours across the world,” Sabo said. The Chairman said peace, tolerance, steadfastness, perseverance; love for one another would go a long way in saving the country from disintegration and total collapse. He advised Muslims in the country not to use the occasion for merriment alone, but to reflect on issues aggravating insecurity, terrorism, corruption, joblessness, violence and instability in the country.(NAN)
