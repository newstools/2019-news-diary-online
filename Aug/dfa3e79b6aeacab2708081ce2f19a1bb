By Abdallah el-Kurebe, Editor Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko says he has successfully defended his Doctorate degree thesis at Ahmadu Bello University,Â  Zaria. Stating this at the National Universities Commission (NUC) in Abuja last week, where he went to pick forms for the establishment of North West University of Science, the Senate Committee Chairman on Defence disclosed that his acquisition of PhD was only to inspire the younger generation to pursue education. Wamakko said if established, it would be the first private university in the Northwest region of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states to cater for the large number of students that turn out annually to seek university education. He commended NUC for its unflinching support during his tenure as governor of Sokoto, when the state university was established. Earlier, the NUC Executive Secretary, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, lamented the lack of private universities in the Northwest axis of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states that would take care of the needs of the teeming populace in that su region. He also commended the Senator for establishing the university with a view to uplifting the standard of education in the area and the entire nation.
