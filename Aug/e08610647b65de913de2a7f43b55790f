The
Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC)  on Sunday,
August 25,
declared that its recruitment exercise is free of any charge from prospective
applicants.
The Corps reiterated that its ongoing recruitment process is completely “free
of charge” and executed in an equitable and transparent manner.
It warned the public and especially applicants not to have any financial
dealings with anyone as a guarantee for the recruitment into the service.
The Corps said it was working to apprehend the perpetrators of the illegal
activities.
Ekunola Gbenga, the Media Assistant to the Commandant-General, announced this
in a statement on Sunday in Abuja.
Ekunola said Information reaching the NSCDC indicated that some unscrupulous
individuals were extorting money from unsuspecting applicants/candidates under
the false impression that they can guarantee their eventual recruitment into
the Service.
He said the ongoing Recruitment Exercise is completely free of charge.
“Therefore, no applicant is required to make any payments to any individuals or
bank accounts at any time during the recruitment process.
