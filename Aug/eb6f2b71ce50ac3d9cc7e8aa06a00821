For about four days,  the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) detained the nation’s  the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita. Highly informed sources disclosed to Newsdiaryonline that so far, over N2.5billion illicit funds, through  contracts by proxies and phony firms, have been linked with her. Furthermore, it was learnt that she was detained  last Thursday,quizzed and let off the hook during the Eid-el Kabir festival. She is however on bail pending the conclusion of the present probe by EFCC. Some powerful forces were said to be rallying around the embattled Head of Service for what a source described as soft landing. The same bigwigs had been trying to cover up in her office as “if she is officially unavailable.” Insiders said that Oyo-Ita might face trial if a prima facie case is established against her.”She is likely to be arraigned alongside a former minister. Some Permanent Secretaries, allegedly used by the Head of Service for contracts,  were said to be under investigation too. Efforts to get an official comment on the  matter from EFCC failed. Some sources monitoring the development fear that the Head of Service may be  removed in the light of this development.
