The liberal German weekly Die Zeit has said that the number
of attacks in the U.S., especially by white nationalists has increased since
Donald Trump assumed the presidency. The weekly newspaper made this known in its editorial
comments on Trump’s reaction to the increasing number of gun attacks in the
U.S. In an editorial in its latest edition published on Thursday,
the paper writes, in part: “Since Trump assumed the presidency, the number of attacks
has increased, especially by white nationalists. “It is a president’s responsibility to condemn such
abominations – with no ifs, ands, or buts. “He must not make common cause with racists by way of a sly
wink of an eye. “Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president, expressed it simply when
he speaks of ‘decency’. “Such appeals also touch Trump voters. The reckoning will be
(at the ballot box) in 2020.” dpa/NAN
