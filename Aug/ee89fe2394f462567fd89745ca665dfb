Mr Raufu Lawal, the Deputy National President of Agro dealers Association, has decried multiple taxation of the association by some government agencies. Lawal, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja, noted that multiple taxation by government agencies was affecting the agro chemical business in Nigeria. He urged the federal government to regulate all tariffs by different government agencies, saying that these agencies were claiming to have been assigned to carry out the same mandate.“We find it difficult to bring all the contending parties together. “NAFDAC has its regulating role, the Federal Ministry of Environment, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture as well as the Standard Organisation of Nigeria have theirs; everyone claims a right in this regulation,” he said. “We have been finding it difficult to bear, so we appeal to the federal government to bring these parties together in order to relieve the suffering of our members. ”He called for a policy review that would spell out how to bring all these contending parties together and let them be on the same page, as agro dealers were currently the ones at the receiving end. Lawal said the overlapping roles of government agencies could promote fake and adulterated products in Nigerian markets, and stressed the need to quicken the policy review in the interest of all stakeholders.
