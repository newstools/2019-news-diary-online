`Say No Campaign’, a non-governmental organisation , has urged traditional rulers, community and religious leaders, market women and youths to assist in the ongoing efforts to combat corruption at the grassroots. Co-convener of the group, Mr Jaye Gaskia, made the appeal in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. Gaskia said that the campaign against corruption should not be left for the government alone. “The fight against corruption is a fight for every person, every group, association and not just the Federal Government only. “Nigerians must join the fight against corruption at the grassroots by changing their orientation on cutting corners, shunting on queues, beating traffic lights and taking or giving bribes. “Impatience has been identified as a major act of corruption at the grassroots, making corruption to thrive and we must stop it,’’ he said. According to him, grand corruption involves election rigging and embezzlement while retail corruption is bribing to cut corners. He encouraged Nigerians to imbibe the culture of holding their leaders accountable for public funds and blowing the whistle on those involved in corrupt practices. Similarly, Mrs Adenike Olasoji, a market women President in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), appealed to parents and guardians to teach and inculcate in their children and wards good morals and the fear of God. According to her, these categories of people are the first role models and mentors that children and wards will first encounter in life. “Whatever is exhibited by parents and guardians will automatically translate into the lives of their children and wards. “So, to curb corruption we must start with parents, guardians, teachers and even religious leaders making efforts to teach their children and the youth the fear of God and good morals,’’ she said.(NAN)
