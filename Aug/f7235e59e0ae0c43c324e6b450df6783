The Oyo State House of Assembly on
Thursday directed all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to appear
before it for budget defence. The Speaker of the House, Adebo
Ogundoyin, gave the directive on the floor of the House while inaugurating the
committees saddled with the responsibility of screening the state’s
Appropriation (Review) Bill, 2019 of N171 billion sent to it by the executive. Ogundoyin said that the focus of the
budget was to cut down by 40 percent the budget of the previous administration
in the state. “This is to meet up with the
objectives of the present administration,” he added. He said a breakdown of the budget
proposal as presented by the executive showed N94, 250, 021, 702 . 03 as
recurrent expenditure while capital expenditure stood at N76, 749, 978, 297
.97. The House had forwarded the bill to
the House Committees on Public Account, Finance and Appropriation for further
consideration after it passed through second reading. The Deputy Speaker, Mr Abiodun
Fadeyi, called for quick action on the bill, saying that this would enable
government to meet up with the expectations of the people. The Majority Leader, Mr Sanjo
Adedoyin and Minority Leader, Mr Asimiyu Alarape, also appealed to the
committees to work with relevant bodies to ensure speedy passage of the budget. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that the budget defence is expected to last for three days.(NAN)
