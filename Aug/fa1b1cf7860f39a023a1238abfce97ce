The Federal Roads Safety Corp (FRSC) has partnered with Akin
Fadeyi Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation, to fight corruption. Nabila Okino, programme officer of the foundation, announced this in a
statement on Wednesday. She said efforts were in place to launch an application called FLAGIT,
explaining that the app was designed for reporting corruption. The organisation is the
convener of “Corruption Not In My Country” project, a micro level
anti-corruption TV drama. Okino said the MacArthur Foundation funded the app to boost service delivery
of FRSC officials. She said the fight against corruption in the country necessitated the
partnership with major stakeholders including, security agencies. “FLAGIT shall serve as a tool to strengthen FRSC’s capacity to be
integrity-driven, improve on public service delivery and be very responsive to
public feedback. It shall also be a platform where citizens can provide
positive feedback on credible and outstanding officers,” she said. “Due to the depth of endemic corruption in our society, it was impossible to
achieve meaningful gains in the fight against corruption without partnering
with major stakeholders.” In his remark, Boboye Oyeyemi, FRSC corps marshall, said the collaboration
with the security agency will result in the use of technological innovation as
a “mechanism for feedback, analytics and insight garnering for improved service
delivery.” He said the application will contribute to the improvement of FRSC services,
like similar innovative projects such as the joint surveillance activity,
service improvement, as well as a verification portal which helps in tracking
fake licenses issued to members of the public. Dayo Olaide, deputy director, MacArthur Foundation in Nigeria, commended the
organisations for the partnership. He said the MacArthur Foundation is seeking ways to collaborate with
credible organisations and government agencies in a bid to fight corruption in
the country. -The Cable
