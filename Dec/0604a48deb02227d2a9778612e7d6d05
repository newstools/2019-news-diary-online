Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Board of the Niger Delta Development
Commission (NDDC) be “recomposed and inaugurated after the forensic audit of
the organization.” Presidential Spokesman, Femi Adesina, who disclosed this in a statement Thursday, added that “the President has also directed that the Interim Management Team of the NDDC shall be in place till the forensic is completed, and that the supervision of the Commission shall remain under the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs.” Newsdiaryonline reports that the presidential statement is a tacit approval of the moves by Godswill Akpabio, Minister of  Niger Delta Affairs. Akpabio
had come under heavy criticism for setting up an interim management  after president had named a new board which
has since been confirmed by the Senate. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
