President
Muhammadu Buhari on Monday in Daura, Katsina State, said Nigeria’s
socio-economic and political salvation will come from education, urging
citizens to embrace learning as a way of life while the government will do its
best to provide access. The
President, who was honoured in his country home, Daura, to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of Community Secondary School, Daura, said he
became an orphan at a young age, but his nine years in boarding school and
joining the army shaped his life. The
President and five others founded the Community Secondary School as community
service. “I
spent nine years in the boarding school where the teachers showered us with
love, care and total commitment. They treated you as their own children. “They
commended you when you did well, and flogged you on bare buttocks if you
misbehaved,” said the President. He
praised the current management of the school, which is now renamed Pilot
Secondary School, Daura, for maintaining high standards. President
Buhari implored the old boys association to carry on the good work they were
going, leading up to the current position of the school. The
leader of the team, Alhaji M.T Bature, the Sarkin Kudu of Katsina, said the
vision of the founding fathers, including the President, had ensured the
success of so many sons of the state, with many growing up to become
professors, engineers, doctors and military generals.
