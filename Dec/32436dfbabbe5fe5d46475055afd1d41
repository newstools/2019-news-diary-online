The All Progressives Congress(APC)
National Leader,  Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has allegedly seized APC’s 
register which contains all bonafide members across the country, the APC Youth
Vanguard has alleged. In a statement issued by  its
publicity secretary, Malam Aliyu Isa Moriki  on Tuesday, Tinubu is in
cahoots with the embattled Deputy National Chairman of the party, Senator 
Lawali Shuaibu who has been Asiwaju’s political associate for a long time. The statement further  alleged
that   the APC Registration Server has been based in the old ACN
office in Abuja since 2013 and Asiwaju Tinubu  has tightly
controlled  the register  and access to it in states not controlled
by his  lackeys. ‘’This afternoon based on
credible  information from Sen Lawali  Shuaibu, Asiwaju has ordered
that the register and server be dismantled and moved to Lagos to one of his
private offices or his house at Bourdillon,’’ the statement added. The APC Youth Vanguard further said
that some  patriotic party members are however ‘’making frantic efforts to
stop this and prevent the illegal hijack of the membership register of
Nigeria’s ruling party.’’ According to the statement,
‘’Asiwaju wants to control the server to enable him deregister his adversaries
and make  everyone beg and agree to terms before giving access to the
party’s membership register.’’ The group further said that the
National Leader  plans ‘’to destroy the register if he fails to get the
APC  presidential ticket,  or  move the entire membership to the
new party which  they are working on as a back up to APC,  along with
some splinter groups in the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) and All
Progressives  Grand Alliance(APGA).’’ There was no immediate response from Tinubu’s political camp. Like!! Great article post.Really thank you! Really Cool.
