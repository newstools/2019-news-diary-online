By Haruna Salami The Senate at its sitting on Wednesday amended Public Procurement Act 
2007 and increased  mobilisation of local contractors from 15 to 30 per
cent. The upper chamber also reduced the time frame for contract award to two
weeks for processing and four days to issue certificates to qualified
contractors. Many senators during the consideration of the report argued that the current
mobilisation fee for local contractors was inadequate and that it usually led
to contracts abandonment. Sponsors of the bill included Senators Shaibu Isa Lau, Uche Ekwunife and
Danlami Sankara. The passage of the bill, according to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan was
“putting icing on the cake” of what they will do in the Senate on
Thursday by passing 2020 budget. The report of the Appropriation Committee was
laid Wednesday. Already they have passed the Finance Bill and now the Procurement Bill both
of which will help in the implementation of the 2020 budget. Lawan said public procurement has been a “bottle neck” in the
development process in the country and with the passage of the Amendment Bill
Wednesday,  the 2020 budget will hopefully record smooth implementation.
