The Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission, EFCC on Thursday, December 18, 2019 secured the final forfeiture of
properties belonging to one Goddy Nnadi, general manager, Corporate Service,
Petroleum Equalization Fund, (PEF) and Galbani Nigeria Limited, before Justice
Folashade Giwa of the Federal High court, Abuja. Nnadi is being prosecuted by the EFCC
for offences bordering on conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. He is
alleged to have sometime in 2006, used the names of some proxies to incorporate
Galbani Nigeria Limited with the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, after which
he opened the company’s bank accounts with Zenith Bank Plc and Ecobank
Plc. Counsel to the EFCC, E.E. Iheanacho who
filed the motion on notice for the final forfeiture, urged the judge to order
that the properties be forfeited to the federal government.  They include:
a two storey plaza, located on Plot C46, 5221 Road, Block xxiic Gwarimpa II,
Estate Abuja and four detached bungalows, located on Plot NO 77, 525 Road, A
Close, Kubwa Estate, Phase iv, Abuja. In the application, the EFCC counsel
argued that “no cause has been shown as to why the properties under interim
forfeiture should not be finally forfeited to the Federal Government of
Nigeria,” and moreover, they are “reasonably suspected to be proceeds
of unlawful activities.” Iheanacho, further posited that the
EFCC has complied with the order of the court to publish the interim forfeiture
order in a national daily by doing so in Leadership newspaper. Delivering  his judgement, Justice Giwa granted the prayers contained in the EFCC’s application, dated December 2, 2019, having been convinced that the properties were acquired with proceeds of crime.(EFCC Press Release) Like!!
