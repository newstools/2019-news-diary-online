The All Progressives Congress,APC
has opened up on the alleged N90bn or N40bn FIRS 2019 election vote. Speaking
on the raging reports on the alleged election campaign fund,APC Spokesman, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu dismissed
the claims as hogwash. He 
said Mondat, “Regarding some media reports and a statement from the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleging that a phantom N90 billion or N40
billion was released to the All Progressives Congress (APC) by the Federal
Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for the Party’s 2019 election political
campaigns, the allegation is hogwash. “The baseless allegations contained
in the media reports and the subsequent statement by the PDP is an
unintelligent and crude attempt at a smear campaign. Only the sponsors of the
report believe their tales. “We call on the sponsors of the
baseless allegation to resolve their confusion. Last time it was N90 billion, now
it is N40billion. We also challenge them to provide evidence from not only FIRS
but any other government agency where the APC took one kobo for campaign. Issa –Onilu said “The matter of
dipping hands into public coffers as a matter of official policy ended with
PDP. We recall that leaders of the PDP had contemplated changing the name of
their party at a time because they were ashamed of their own record of sleaze. “We however refer the PDP and
co-peddlers of falsehood to the records of the Federation Accounts Allocation
Committee (FAAC) in terms of Cost of Collection accruing to FIRS and indeed the
FIRS statement on the subject matter.” Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
