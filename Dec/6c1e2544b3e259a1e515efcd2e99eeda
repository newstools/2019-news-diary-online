The White House on Monday confirmed
Russian President Vladimir Putin, called U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday,
to thank him for information that helped foil a potential holiday terrorist
attack on Russia. White House Deputy Press Secretary
Hogan Gidley, said Putin thanked Trump for information the U.S. provided. “Trump and Putin committed to
continuing their counter-terrorism cooperation during the call,” Gidley said. He said Putin and Trump also
discussed the state of relations between the US and Russia and future efforts
to support effective arms control,’’ Gidley said. Russian state media reported on
Sunday that authorities prevented an attack in the city of St Petersburg,
following a tip-off from the U.S. The Interfax news agency quoted the
domestic secret service FSB, as saying that two Russian citizens had been
arrested on Friday in connection with the incident. It reported that they had planned to
carry out a terrorist attack on crowded locations during New Year celebrations. “The investigators seized evidence
which confirmed the plans for an attack,’’ it added. The FSB said that U.S. intelligence
had provided the tip-off. (dpa/NAN)
