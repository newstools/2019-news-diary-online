This was shortly after failed attempt to rearrests him inside the court of the Federal High Court in Abuja, Friday morning. ChannelsTV reports that Sowore is currently being held at the DSS office in Abuja, even though it was yet to disclose the reason for the re-arrest.

Mr Falana in a phone conversation told Channels Television that the DSS claimed they wanted to ask Sowore a few questions but ended up detaining him and his co-defendant, Bakare.
