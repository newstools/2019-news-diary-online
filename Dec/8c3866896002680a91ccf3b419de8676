The Hope Democratic Party (HDP) and its presidential candidate in the last general election, Albert Owuru, have filed a suit against the Federal Government before the ECOWAS Court, demanding N800 billion for alleged violation of rights. In the suit, the regional court was asked to intervene in the dismissive manner in which the Supreme Court of Nigeria handled its appeal against President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the Feb.23 presidential election. The defendants are Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the apex court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on technical ground that the appeal was filed six days outside of the 60 days mandated by the constitution to hear Presidential Election Appeals. The parties are seeking a declaration that the defendants orchestrated the Oct. 28 date for the applicants’ appeal which is outside the 60 days  to hear appeal that arose from tribunal’s judgment on Aug. 22. They are also seeking a declaration that the failure and refusal of the defendants to institute, establish, and promote an independent court system to ensure and guarantee the protection of the applicants’ rights to justice and equity resulted in the alleged violation of their rights. NAN reports that no date has been fixed for hearing. Mr Chukuwuma Njoku, the applicants’ counsel who spoke on the appeal to newsmen on Friday in Abuja, said his clients proceeded to the regional court to seek redress. “We have proceeded to seek redress for our violated right to have our case heard before ECOWAS Court of Justice. “We are seeking the payment of the sum of N800 billion as damages for the violation of the applicants’ fundamental human rights throughout the period of the case in Nigerian courts,’’ Njoku said.(NAN) Like!!
