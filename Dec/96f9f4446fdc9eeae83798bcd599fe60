In commemoration of the world AIDS
day, a day set aside by the United Nations to show love, care and support to
people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, Future Assured in conjunction with
the National Agency for the control of AIDS (NACA) organised an HIV/AIDS prevention
Sensitisation Program for adolescents and Youth Corps Members. This year’s theme is “Communities Make the Difference”.A statement from
the organisers said the event had over a hundred participants from the National
Youth Service Corps and Representatives from about 50 schools in the FCT. The program targeted the Head boys
and Head girls of Secondary school as well as Peer educator Trainers of the
NYSC to ensure that the information provided was passed down to as many young
persons as possible. According to the statement, this is
intended to carry along the adolescents and youth community in the fight
against the spread of HIV. A football match bye NACA and ABF
was also held for the same purpose. It would be recalled that the First
Lady Dr Mrs Aisha Buhari as the  EMTCT  (Elimination of mother to
child transmission) champion, earlier in the week had engaged adolescents and
youth groups alongside persons living with HIV (PLWHIV) community with NACA to
discuss improved strategies for preventing the spread of HIV. This program was organized by the
Future Assured organization of Aisha Buhari Foundation, with support from the
Chinese Government. Like!! Thank you for publishing this awesome article.
