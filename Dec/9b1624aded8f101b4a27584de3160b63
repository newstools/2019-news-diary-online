Former Vice President of
Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar has described as disheartening and unfortunate the
passing away of his longstanding lieutenant and seasoned political ally, Dame
Titilayo Ajanaku, a former presidential special adviser on women’s affairs and
first female local government chairman in Nigeria. In a condolence message
released in Abuja on Friday, the Waziri of Adamawa lamented the loss of an
unwavering democrat, who committed her life to the betterment of society. “Titi was a passionate
politician and a compassionate compatriot, who participated in politics as a
means to the end of alleviating people’s pains, through the establishment of a
free and fair; egalitarian and just society. She was urbane and humane,
cerebral and a great team player. “She was a force to reckon with
in both the People’s Democratic Party and the Peoples Democratic Movement,
where she made huge political contributions towards nation building. She was
equally a personal friend, a political ally and frontline woman leader who
championed the cause of women in politics. “She was a competent
administrator and astute adviser. She served in our administration
(Obasanjo-Atiku 1999-2007) in charge of women affairs, and made indelible
impact; counseling the government to doing the right things for women in
Nigeria. Her demise is a great loss to the nation and to all who knew her. Hers
is a vacuum hard to fill”, the PDP presidential flagbearer in the 2019 election
said. Atiku Abubakar prayed for the
Almighty God to grant comfort and strength to the family, friends and
associates to bear the loss, and for her soul to rest in peace. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
