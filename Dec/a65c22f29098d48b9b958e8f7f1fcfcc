The Defence Headquarters has
dismissed the allegation of embezzlement in the military by a whistle blower
claiming underpayment of soldiers as provided in the Manual of Financial
Administration for the Armed Forces of Nigeria (MAFA) 2017. The Acting Director, Defence
Information, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement on Tuesday, said that
the MAFA document had not been activated for implementation. According to him, the DHQ wishes to
clarify that the insinuation that personnel of the Armed Forces are under
remunerated as against the provisions of MAFA 2017 is unfounded and untrue. “Contrary to the claims made by the
Twitter handle @ millisaint, the said document has not been activated and
therefore yet to be implemented, since the appropriation 2020 was recently
passed. “The provisions of the MAFA document
are thus, billed to be operational in year 2020. “It is also essential to point out
that MAFA allowances are not part of the Salary Structure of the Armed Forces, consequently,
even when implemented the salary structure will remain unchanged. “The anticipated impactful change on
the salary structure will only come as a result of the recently approved
N30,000 minimum wage that will be paid by IPPIS,” he said. Nwachukwu, however, challenged the
whistle blower to endeavour to verify his information from reliable and
authourised sources to establish the veracity of his information in order to
avoid causing disaffection within the ranks of the Armed Forces. “Members of the public are please
enjoined to discountenance the misinformation as it is misguided and bereft of
any iota of truth. “The DHQ wishes to reassure all
personnel of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and members of the public that
personnel welfare is paramount in the vision and mission of the current
leadership of the military. “Any form of short changing of
personnel will be met with stiff penalties,” he said. NAN
