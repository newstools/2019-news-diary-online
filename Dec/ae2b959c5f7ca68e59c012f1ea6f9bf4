President
Muhammadu Buhari has commended the admirable life lived by Abdullahi Dauda, his
nephew, and prayed to Allah to shower his blessings on the soul of the deceased. Speaking Wednesday in Kaduna through a
delegation he sent to the family of the late nephew, the President said the
late Abdullahi lived a life of service to fellow citizens and the nation,
worthy of emulation. The delegation, led by Jalal Arabi, Permanent
Secretary, State House, prayed that the goodness that marked the life of the
deceased will follow him to the grave, reflecting at the same time, on the
family that survived him. The delegation, which was received by
the older brothers of the deceased, Abdul-Mudallab Dauda and Malam Mamman
Daura, included the Senior Special Assistants to the President, Sarki Abba and
Garba Shehu; the State Chief of Protocol, Ambassador Lawal Kazaure; Chief
Personal Security Officer, (CPSO), Abdulkarim Dauda; the Special Assistant in
the President’s office, Sabi’u Yusuf Tunde; Member, House of Representatives,
Sha’aban Sharada; and the Technical Assistant to the Minister of State,

thanked him for sending the delegation, and consoled him in turn for the loss
of the nephew. Like!! Great article post.Really thank you! Really Cool.
