The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has described the
appointment of a new Chairman for the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) as
timely and auspicious, considering the state of suspended animation that has characterised
tax collection which continued to reflect in low revenue generation for the
Federal Government. In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy
Madueke, the pro Buhari group noted that the apparent limited capacity of the
FIRS under its erstwhile Chairman, to efficiently facilitate an effective tax
collection system through bringing more tax paying entities into the national
tax net, has turned the country into a net borrower of urgently needed funds to
finance desired critical infrastructural projects. “The reality is that Nigeria is fast becoming a debt dependent economy
with dire consequences for the cost of capital formation and economic
sustainability. This is principally because the FIRS failed to ramp up tax collection
which is the primary source of any nation’s income to fund national budget’s
recurrent and capital expenditures,” the BMO said. “We cannot continue to be rolling out deficit budgets from year to year
without any hope of a reversal to sustainable balance, or even surplus budget
circle. To achieve this, there’s an obvious need for a change of approach and
vision through leadership change which President Muhammad Buhari has
conscientiously effected through the appointment of a seasoned tax consultant and
administrator, Mr Muhammad Nami, as the new Chairman of the FIRS. “To enhance the new FIRS service delivery capacity, the
President has also constituted a new board of directors composed of a
member representing each of the six geographical zones and statutory
representatives from a select number of ministries and government
agencies,” the BMO noted in the statement. In consideration of the President forwarding the names of the new Chairman and
the board members to the Senate for confirmation, BMO urged the Senate to fast
track the screening and confirmation of the nominated FIRS Chairman and board
members. “We call on the Senate to expeditiously screen and confirm the new
appointees as forwarded by President Buhari  especially, in consideration
of the urgent task of driving revenue generation to fund the 2020 budget
recently approved by both chambers of the National Assembly”, the
statement added.
