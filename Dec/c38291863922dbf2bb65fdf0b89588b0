Borno Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum on Friday signed
the 2020 appropriation bill into law during which he told commissioners that he
will not entertain any submission to fund any project or programme that is not
provided for in the budget. He spoke at the executive council chambers of the Government House
in Maiduguri. Zulum presented his first budget of N134.5 on December 2,
2019 to the state assembly and the lawmakers passed the budget on December 23
with an increase to N146.8 billion for which the assembly’s deputy speaker,
Abdullahi Musa Askira explained,  was to make up for gaps identified by
the lawmakers during deliberations. The Governor thanked the assembly members  for accelerated
passage of the budget and said he intends to be strict in adhering ‎to
provisions. “Under no circumstance should any member of the executive council
(mostly commissioners) make  any financial submission that is not provided
for in the 2020 budget. All submissions to the executive council or to me must
follow the provisions of the budget. Submissions will first of all be subjected
to budgetary evaluation to ensure there is provision for them before the
submissions are even considered. If we follow the provisions of the budget, we
will make things easier for ourselves and we will achieve so much in orderly
manner. We will be strict in implementing our budget” Zulum said. Deputy Speaker Askira said earlier that the lawmakers were happy
with the governor’s policy of respecting the separation of powers ‎which
guarantees the independence of the legislature. The Governor’s policy, he
noted, makes them carry out their oversight functions most effectively. Borno’s Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Barrister
Kaka Shehu Lawan who coordinated the brief ‎ceremony, quoted constitutional
provisions upon which the governor presented and signed the budget into
law.
