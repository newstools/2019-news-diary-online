said the Federal Government on Friday, December 6, 2019, filed a new and
substantive challenge in the English Courts, in its ongoing fight against the Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID). The filing, which is a major step forward in their bid to overturn the
injustice of the US$9.6 billion award, challenges both the underlying arbitral
award and its enforcement, and lodges a fresh appeal against the subsequent
High Court judgment. It was learnt that the lawyers argued that, based on new evidence that
has come to light in recent investigations, the original contract was a sham
commercial deal and designed to fail from the outset. They attributed the
discovery to President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption efforts spearheaded
by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Also, the challenge further argued that the GSPA (gas supply and
processing agreement) was procured based on fraud and corruption, while the
subsequent arbitral process was riddled with irregularities and deliberately
concealed from the rest of the Government. The filing is a significant step forward in the Federal Government’s
effort to secure justice for Nigeria. It could be recalled that  Federal Government had recently expanded its
legal team, to include leading London law firm Mishcon de Reya. The team is led
by Shaistah Akhtar, Partner, and Mark Howard QC of Brick Court Chambers. The
expansion will enable the Federal Government to launch in full its
investigations and challenges.
