“I
am extremely grateful for the recognition and award of the “Integrity Specialty
of the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism’s Anti-corruption
Defender Award of 2019” to me.
“The award, I note, is for our Justice reform efforts in Lagos State. I had
accepted the award with pride on behalf of the excellent Justice Sector team we
had.
“However, two reasons explain my absence. First is that I am currently in Abu
Dhabi for an international meeting under the auspices of the government of the
UAE where I am the keynote speaker.
“Second, in view of the developments on Friday in the Sowore case, I think it
would be insensitive and inappropriate to attend the ceremony. 
“Please accept my heartfelt apologies and extend the same to the other members
of the organizing team. God bless you.”
