Determined to further her quest to
contribute positively to the host country in her own little way, the spouse of
the Nigerian High Commissioner to Ghana, Mrs. Margaret Kikelomo Abikoye on 29th November, 2019 donated some items to the deaf,
dumb and blind students of Mampong School in Akuapim, Eastern Region of Ghana. The donation was done in collaboration with spouses and officers of the Nigerian High
Commission in Ghana, the Nigerian Union of Traders Association, Ghana Chapter
and the Nigerian Women Association Ghana. Some of the items donated
include foodstuffs, toiletries, game items worth about GHC40,000.00. Speaking while handing over the
items, Mrs Abikoye said the decision to make donation to the school was borne
of the realisation that the Government of Ghana cannot do it all hence, the
need for the society to contribute its quota. According to her, it is also the
season of love and giving, saying the team decided to show love to the children
and let them know they are special and well appreciated. During interaction with the
children, they presented mirage of challenges, most important was the request
for a sickbay. The authority was asked to map out a place in the school for
this project, which the team promised to look into and undertake. Responding, the Headmistress of the
School for the Blind, Akropong, Madam Mahela Narh, appreciated the efforts of
the team, stating that the children have imbedded in them great potentials and
what they need is more of empathy than sympathy. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
