 By
Atiku Abubakar Today,
I am in extreme anguish of spirit having watched the unfortunate drama that
played itself out at the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in which agents
of the state not only caused a commotion in court in order to frustrate a
judgment of a court of competent authority. Never in the history of Nigerian democracy has a judge been
treated in such a disdainful and brazen attack on not just her person and
office, but on the entire judiciary. This is unacceptable. It is a rape on the
sanctity of the court. Nigeria is not a dictatorship. We are a democracy, no
matter how inconvenient this fact is to the powers that have forced themselves
on us. I call for an immediate inquiry to be set up to identify those
responsible for the maltreatment meted out to Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu and the
desecration of her court, and indeed the Nigerian judiciary. They must be
sanctioned to the highest extent permissible by our laws. I further call for all law enforcement agencies in Nigeria to
immediately respect not just the court order made by Justice Ojukwu, but the
order of any court in Nigeria, on any detainee, be it Omoyele Sowore, Sambo
Dasuki or Ibrahim Zakzaky, among others. We cannot have a situation where our government is quick to obey
foreign court orders and even quicker to disobey domestic court orders. This is
symptomatic of a mindset that is servile to foreign powers and brutal to
Nigerians. Without the rule of law, there can be no rule at all. Power in
Nigeria still flows from the people, not from the barrel of a gun. I call on
all men and women of goodwill not to keep quiet or sit on the fence at times
like this. To keep Nigeria a democracy is the paramount duty of all
concerned stakeholders. Please speak up against this tyranny and side with the
Nigerian people. Atiku
