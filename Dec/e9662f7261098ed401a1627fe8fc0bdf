The Federal Government
has rejected the US designation of Nigeria as a country that engages in or
tolerates severe violations of religious freedom, saying the iniquitous tag
stems from an orchestrated narrative that has
long been discredited In a statement issued
in Abuja on Sunday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai
Mohammed, said the good people of Nigeria enjoy unfettered freedom to practise
their religion, and blamed failed politicians and disgruntled elements – some
of them supposedly-respected leaders –  for latching on to religion as
their trump card, especially in the run up to the last general elections, to oust
the Buhari Administration. He said it is
unfortunate that the US fell for the antics of the discontented and the
unpatriotic few, who will not hesitate to hang Nigeria out to dry on the altar
of their inordinate ambition and their sheer animosity towards the
Administration. The Minister said the
Nigerian government is acutely aware of how the political opposition, in
particular, had spared no resources in deriving political capital from the
various security challenges in the country ”The deliberate
effort to give religious coloration to the farmers-herders clashes and the Boko
Haram insurgency, in particular, has undoubtedly helped to mislead the US into
concluding that the government is doing little or nothing to guarantee
religious freedom in the country. ”But, as we have
always said, the farmers-herders clashes have nothing to do with religion but
everything to do with environmental and socio-economic realities. The religious
tag given to the clashes has no basis in fact, but is very convenient for those
who will very easily give the dog a bad name just to hang it. On its part, the
Boko Haram terrorists are extreme fanatics who do not subscribe to the tenets of any
religion, in spite of their pretence to Islamic adherence,” he said. Alhaji Mohammed said
the good news is that the government has succeeded in curbing the
farmers-herders clashes through the implementation of proactive and
multi-dimensional strategy, which is yielding remarkable
results, just as it has largely defeated the Boko Haram insurgency. On the El-Zakzaky
issue, which was referred to in the report by the US government, he described
it is purely a criminal matter, which is being handled by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Minister said
while the government welcomes constructive criticism from any quarter, it
rejects any attempt to sow the seed of mistrust among the various religious
groups in the country.
