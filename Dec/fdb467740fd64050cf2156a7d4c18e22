By Haruna Salami Senate has frowned at  the Central
Bank of Nigeria, CBN, especially  in the
way and manner it allegedly handles the sale of foreign exchange to the public. This was the outcome of a meeting of its Committee on Ethics, Privileges and
Public Petitions held on Wednesday to consider a petition against the CBN over
its handling of foreign exchange. Although the CBN was represented at the Wednesday meeting of the committee,
the chairman of the committee, Senator Ayo Akinyelure insisted that the CBN
Governor,  Godwin Emefiele must appear in person before the committee on
February 7, 2020. The committee wondered why CBN should sell foreign currencies to middlemen
before it gets to  the public, adding that “CBN should sell to public
directly”. At the  same meeting the committee listened to the petition of one
Mr.  Charles Akinwon against the Nigerian Navy (NN) over wrongful dismissal
from service. After listening to  both parties, the NN admitted its mistake and
agreed to reinstate the officer and pay his salary from 1990 to date. Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
