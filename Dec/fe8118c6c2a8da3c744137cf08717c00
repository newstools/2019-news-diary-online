President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated
with oil and gas industry investor, Chief (Dr) Leemon Ikpea, as he turns 63 on
December 19, 2018. Femi Adesina,
Special Adviser to the President
(Media and Publicity) said in a
statement Wednesday that  the President applauds the dint of hard
work and grace of God, which brought Chief Ikpea from modest beginnings to the
topmost rungs of the business ladder today. “President Buhari notes that Lee
Engineering and Construction Company, of which Chief Ikpea is Chairman/Chief
Executive Officer, is one of the home-grown investors in the oil and gas
industry, thus proving that Nigerians can hold their own in the highly
technical sector. “The President rejoices with family,
friends and associates of the celebrant, salutes the milk of human kindness,
which has seen him awarding innumerable scholarships and bequests to uplift the
weak and downtrodden, and commends same to other well-to-do Nigerians,” Adesina
said. President Buhari prayed that Chief Ikpea
will continue to serve God and humanity in good health, and be blessed with
long life and prosperity. Like!! I blog quite often and I genuinely thank you for your information. The article has truly peaked my interest.
