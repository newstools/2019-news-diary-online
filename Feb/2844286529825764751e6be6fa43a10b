By Folasade Akpan #TrackNigeria -Election Observation Missions of the European Union (EU), African Union (AU), United Nations (UN) and others have called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to finalise all preparations and ensure that the new election dates are adhered to. They said this in a joint statement signed by eight organisations and made
available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja, in light of
the postponement of the general elections. Other signatories to the statement are the election observation missions of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Commonwealth Observer
Group and the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa. Some others are the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the National
Democratic Institute/International Republican Institute. They also said that INEC should provide regular updates and information
to the public on its preparations in the coming days and weeks to enhance
confidence and trust in the process. The observers also called on Nigerians to remain calm and support the
electoral process. “We, the Heads of the international election observation missions and the UN
present in Nigeria, have taken note of the decision of INEC to postpone the
2019 general elections due to logistical and operational challenges. “While we note that this decision has caused dissapointment for many, we
call on Nigerians to remain calm and supportive of the electoral process as
INEC works to implement its new timeline. “As we continue to closely observe preparations across the country, we stand
in solidarity with the people of Nigeria in their desire for credible and
peaceful elections.” NAN reports that INEC had shifted the Presidential and National Assembly
elections from Feb.16 to Feb.23, and moved the Governorship and Houses of
Assembly elections from March 2 to March 9. (NAN)
