The executive director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy
Centre (CISLAC) and head of Transparency International (TI) in Nigeria, Auwal
Musa Rafsanjani has showered praises on the Acting Chairman of the Economic and
Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu for the record-setting
achievements of the Commission in the last four years. Rafsanjani who visited
Commission on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 sought the strengthening of the
working relationship between the Commission, CISLAC and TI. He observed that there was need to come up with a new method in
which the EFCC, CISLAC and TI would work together in the areas of asset
recovery, combating illicit financial flows and  money laundering, among
others. “We are here to collaborate so that the fight against corruption
in Nigeria will continue to succeed. We will continue to give our support to
the EFCC because we believe EFCC is doing a lot of good work for the country
and by extension Africa. The good work EFCC it is doing in Nigeria is being
felt by other African countries, that is the reason many countries in the
continent want the EFCC to be replicated in their countries in terms of its
operations,” Rafsanjani stated. He called on the Commission to turn its searchlights on some
non- governmental organisations (NGOs), which he said are owned and run by
Nigeria politicians and civil servants to cover up their loots from the
nation’s treasury. Responding to Rafsanjani, Magu disclosed that the Commission was
open to civil society organizations and others, willing to engage and
collaborate with it. Present at the event was Olanipekun Olukoyede, Secretary to the
Commission and other senior officials of the EFCC. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
