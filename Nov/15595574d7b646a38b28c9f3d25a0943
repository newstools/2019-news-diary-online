The Chief Advisor, Sam Nkire
Political Advisory, Chief Sam Nkire has says the  defeat of the People’s
Democratic Party PDP and Governor Seriake Dickson’s candidate should serve as a
bad lesson to would-be despots in Nigeria. Speaking after the announcement of the governorship election result in Bayelsa State, Chief Nkire said Seriake Dickson behaved  the same way pompous despots kiss the ground, in their final hours of humiliation. Newsdiary online reports that Dickson had on several occasions decried being called a despot or tyrant.He said he was a tried and tested  democrat. According to Nkire, part of the
reasons why the PDP lost in Bayelsa State was that “Governor Dickson did
not believe in zoning, fairness or democracy and therefore, single-handedly
chose a wrong candidate for his party”. He was also of the opinion that
another reason why the people of Bayelsa State may have rejected Senator Douye
Diri was that Governor Dickson, due to greed, wanted to replace Senator Diri at
the Senate, a dream now ‘put on hold’. The erstwhile National Chairman of
the Progressive People’s Alliance PPA,  seized the opportunity of the
shocking Bayelsa experience as well as other recent experiences in other
states, where despotic governors and political godfathers have bitten their
fingers, to advise politicians to be humble and show gratitude to God and their
people for the opportunities to serve, in the first place. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
