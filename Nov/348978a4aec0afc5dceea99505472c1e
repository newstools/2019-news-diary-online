The former governor of Akwa Ibom
State and now Minister of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC,
Godswill Akpabio, has been warned to stop impeding the smooth takeover of the
Commission by the Pius Odubu-led new management board wondering.Niger Delta
stakeholders  issuing the words of
caution also said  they aware that some power
brokers are planning to put other Niger Delta intervention agency under the
control of the former governor. Speaking on   this in
Port Harcout, the Rivers State capital over the weekend after a meeting of
selected ex-militant leaders across the South -South geo-political zone, the
leader of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A,
Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro told newsmen that Akpabio was biting much more
than he can chew by arrogating to himself an unknown power of legislation above
the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria in his “rascality over
who manages a regional entity as big as the NDDC.” They also stated that they are aware
of the subterranean moves by some power brokers in  cahoot with Akpabio to  annex the Presidential Amnesty Programme, PAP,
in a bid to make the former Akwa Ibom state governor the ultimate source for
dispensing favours ahead 2023 general elections. The Coalition noted that Akpabio
should stop holding the NDDC and the people of the Delta region to  ransom.The group which described  the minister’s attitude as reckless noted
that  never in the history of the
intervention agency has there being an Interim Committee usurping the roles of
a legitimate management board. The Coalition wondered: how do
Nigerians read between the lines here when nobody is asking questions why
Akpabio’s grandstanding in the NDDC affairs is being unchallenged by the
authorities who are supposed to so do. The coalition thus called  on the federal government to speak up and take
decisive action against the minister 
over  what the group described as
an affront to the collective intelligence of Nigerians and Niger Deltans in
particular. The group said, Akpabio should not
be allowed to be a judge in his own case because he may be equally be complicit
in the imperfections that bedeviled the Commission over the years and so, his
hold on the Commission must be loosened by a clear  action from the president. Recall that the President on the eve
of his trip to Saudi Arabia, had sent the names of Pius Odubu, Bernard
Okumagba, Prophet Jones Erue among others to the Senate for confirmation as
Chairman, Managing Director, Delta State Representative respectively. The confirmation
screening was carried out by the red chamber promptly with an order to the new
board from the Senate President, Ahmed Lawal, to take over the management of
the Commission.
