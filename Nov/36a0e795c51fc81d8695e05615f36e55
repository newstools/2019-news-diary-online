“You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Indira Gandhi The vitriolic and caustic reaction of Bishop Abiodun Ogunyemi, the combative
Bishop of the historic St. George’s Anglican Church Sabon Gari , Zaria to the
apology tendered by the Anglican Church of Nigeria to Nasir El –  Rufai
,the Governor of Kaduna State, over the orchestrated media campaign by Ogunyemi
and the Reverend Joesph Hayab led Christian Association of Association (CAN),
by the powerful delegation led by the highly respected Dean of the Anglican
Church Archbishop Buba Lamido , is a confirmation that Bishop Ogunyemi’s
mission was to “sufficiently provoke” and force the Kaduna State
Government to demolish the St. George’s Anglican Church,Sabon Gari Zaria. This
assertion is as certain as saying the sun will raise from the East,going by his
conduct. The clear motive behind the acerbic reactions of Ogunyemi and Hayab, his
co-conspirator are manifestly and definitely political. It would be recalled
that some so called opposition had boasted prior to the 2019 General
Elections that they would ensure the defeat of El-Rufai in the 2019 elections
and having woefully failed,they have obviously shifted the battle to the 2023
presidential elections, which many people believe El-Rufai would contest,
despite his vehement denial that he hasn’t given the top job his deserved
attention. But this hasn’t stopped the plot to hang the toga of a religious
fanatic and tribal warlord around his neck,which they hope would 
“kill” his rumored presidential ambition. This apparently is at the
root of the false allegation concocted by Bishop Ogunyemi , who it must be stated
was hastily posted out of Yobe State, due to his cantankerous nature and
Hayab,whose open partisanship has made CAN irrelevant. According to Bishop
Ogunyemi  “The governor (El-Rufai) is being prepared for 2023
elections. The governor (El-Rufai) should know that he will never be president
of Nigeria. I speak prophetically as a servant of the living God.”
Thankfully Ogunyemi is not God! Ogunyemi and his ilks,including those who
predicted the day El-Rufai would die, have refused to learn from their failed
predictions in the past,which explains their haughty predictions,which most
certainly would also fail in the future. A brief history of the St. George’s Anglican Church matter, which would have
sparked a religious crisis due to the unnecessary politicization by Ogunyemi and
Hayab, of what was clearly an innocous mistake, but for the tact handling of
the matter by the kaduna State Government and the Primate of the Anglican of
Nigeria Nicholas Okoh, who also sensibly sidelined Ogunyemi from the
negotiations that saw the state government reiterating what has consistently
been its position since 2016 , that the historic Church would not be demolished
to pave way for the redevelopment of the Sabon Gari market , which by the way
has engulfed the church, because of its history. It must be stressed that El –
Rufai has a sense of history,which is why he reverted Muhammadu Buhari Way, to
Waff road its original name,due its historic background. Waff which is an
abbreviation of West African Frontier Forces is a reminder of the great exploits
of the multi-battalion field force, formed by the British Colonial Office in
1900 to garrison the West African colonies of Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone
and Gambia. On assumption of office in 2015 , the Nasir El-Rufai administration
undertook an extensive and in depth study of previous Reports into the various
crisis that had bedeviled the state. The Reports shockingly revealed that lack
of adequate market shops were at the very root of virtually all the crisis-
from Kasuwa Maigani, Kajuru to the Zangon- Kataf crisis, all had their origin
at the markets- which unfortunately always assumed sectarian/ethnic dimensions.
Like El-Rufai said, “contentions over the location of markets and access
to them have been implicated in the legacy of violence that has blighted some
of our communities.” For instance the decision of the then Chairman of the
Zangon Kataf Local Government Council to relocate the market triggered the
deadly 1992 Zangon – Kataf crisis which was to eventually engulf the entire state.
The Kasuwan Magani crisis like that of Zonkwa,Kafanchan,and Kajuru all started
in and around markets. The conclusions garnered from the reports and the post conflict assessment
of the 2018 Kasuwan Magani crisis further convinced the government to as a matter
of urgency address the market issue. It consequently adopted a two pronged
approach of embarking on massive redevelopment of markets as a strategy of
attacking the root cause of the crisis and as part of the administration’s
Programme of promoting equal opportunity and economic development of the
various communities. For instance the new Kasuwan Magani market will have over
1000 shops,modern abattoirs, police post, clinic and fire service area in
compliance with health, safety and environment regulatory requirements that is
a must for a model market. Hopefully access to shops for everyone who wants to
trade having been addressed,we shouldn’t  have crisis from that front
again. It’s this resolve to address the question of markets that brought the St.
George’s Anglican Church Sabon Gari into focus. What Ogunyemi and Hayab have
bluntly refused to  tell the world, because it doesn’t fit into their evil
plot of demonizing El-Rufai , is that 45 houses,including several mosques were
marked for demolition and for which compensation had been paid, and that the
church was never valued and so no compensation was paid and so even when 
the quit notice was mistakenly issued to the church it amounted to absolutely
nothing because the church had not been compensated. If not mischief,why would
Ogunyemi pretend or feign  ignorance about the solemn pledge by
El-Rufai at the Anglican Synod which held at Owerri to the entire Anglican
Church of Nigeria that he would not to demolish the historic church, in addition
to previous official  letters to that effect. If Ogunyemi can’t remember ,
the Most Reverend Bennett Okoro of the Owerri Ecclesiastical Province can
testify to this statement of fact,because Okoro was the one who asked
El-Rufai  about the fate of the Church,in the light of the government
policy to redevelop the various markets into model markets,which apart from
being flash points, are also eyesores. The Kaduna State Government contrary to the lies being bandied by Ogunyemi
and Hayab never shelved any plan to demolish St. George’s Anglican
Church,because in the first place there wasn’t any such plan. If there was,the
Church would have been valued and paid a hefty compensation,as demanded by the
law. The gospel truth is that Ogunyemi and Hayab thought they finally had their
archenemy El-Rufai in a tight corner,which explains the resort to the
media,rather than engaging with the government and resolving in a peaceful
manner whatever issue that had cropped up. Ogunyemi also in his desire to
scandalize, vilify and portray El-Rufai as a religious fanatic  bluntly
refused to consult with the leadership of the Anglican of Nigeria on the way
forward,just as he refused to reach out to the government when the quit notice
was mistakenly served on the Church. The insults and abuses rained on the
official delegation from the Anglican Church of Nigeria, the custodians of the
church by Ogunyemi is a confirmation of his disappointment at the resolution of
the a crisis that he had created and had hoped to use in his stop El-Rufai “presidential
ambition”. Ogunyemi and Hayab must be delusional thinking that the negative media
campaign against the governor thwarted the demolition of the church. From his
handling of the teachers crisis to the reform of the local government , it’s
obvious that had El-Rufai believed that it was in the greater interest of the
community that the church should be relocated,he wouldn’t have shied away from
that line of action. But the governor wasn’t convinced and so never issued the
directive,moreover he saw through the antics of Ogunyemi and Hayab and refused
them the fame they cheaply seek for -“Defenders of the Faith”.
 In the meeting with the Anglican Church El-Rufai clearly restated the
fact that “over 40 structures that were to be affected by the exercise
were identified and assessed for compensation. Three years later, after it
became clear that the private developer could not raise the funds, KDSG decided
to ask its market development company to fund the project.” So where
did Ogunyemi and Hayab get their facts from,that could have thrown the entire
country into a big crisis? On a final note, Bishop Abiodun Ogunyemi who claims to be a servant of
God,should stop playing God by boasting that El-Rufai would never be president
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Nor does Ogunyemi Statements,calling his
fellow Bishops “fake Christians and religious spies placed in our Church
by a particular religion” show him as a man of peaceful disposition. 
He should find out from many others who had predicted dates that El-Rufai would
die or the margin by which Isa Ashiru would defeat him,how they woefully
failed. That El-Rufai continues to wax stronger in spite of the evil
machinations of the likes of Ogunyemi and Hayab is a testimony to his goodness.
The Anglican of Nigeria deserves the commendation of all men of goodwill for
putting Hayab who had questioned the decision of the church to visit El – Rufai
 in his place,by telling him that they didn’t need his permission to visit
the governor. Hayab,clearly seeks relevance, but because he lacks an
unflinching commitment to truth,he seeks it in vain.
