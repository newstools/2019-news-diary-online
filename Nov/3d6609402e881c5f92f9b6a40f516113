A Police Inspector posted from the
Mobile Police formation in Asaba, Delta State, has been confirmed dead, owing
to gunshot injuries suffered from the mayhem at the aborted rally of the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nembe, Bayelsa state. Members of the PDP were attacked on
Wednesday, at King Koko Square, venue of a PDP rally In Ogbolomabiri,
Nembe. The PDP has blamed the attack on the
opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), with Senator Duoye Diri, the
governorship candidate for Saturdayâ€™s election, calling on President Muhammad
Buhari to declare a state of emergency on Bayelsa volatile areas. The body of the Police Inspector,
whose name was not disclosed, had since been deposited at the Nembe General
Hospital. Another of his colleagues, Mr.
Ododomu was luckier as he survived the attack with gunshot wounds on his leg. Two other policemen who were at the
aborted PDP rally, are said to be critically injured and are battling to
survive. Several other people are reportedly
missing with growing worries from unconfirmed reports that the thugs ripped
open the stomach of their victims and threw them into the nearby river. Medical personnel have been battling
to save lives of the victims at the Specialists Hospital and Federal Medical
Centre, Yenagoa. As at Friday, 39 of the injured have
been discharged on follow up, while 47 are still on admission, with 32 at the
Federal Medical Centre and 15 still gasping for breath at the Specialist
Hospital, Yenagoa.
