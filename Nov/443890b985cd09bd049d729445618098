By Abdallah el-Kurebe The Court of Appeal sitting in Sokoto, on Monday, upheld the election of Senator Aliyu Wamakko, who represents Sokoto North Senatorial District. It also dismissed the Appeal brought before it against the judgement of the National and States Assemblies Elections Tribunal, by Senator Ahmed Maccido of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
