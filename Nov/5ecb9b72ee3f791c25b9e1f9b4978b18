The
Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has condemned the attack on him, the Oba
of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, Chancellor of the Edo University, Iyahmo, Dr.
Aderemi Makanjuola and other guests at the residence of former Governor of
the State and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade
Adams Oshiomhole. Speaking
to journalists after the incident, the governor took exception to the resort to
violence, noting that it was shameful for such an attack to take place at the
residence of the National Chairman of the ruling party in the state and at the
national level. Describing
the attack as unfortunate incident, he said, “It is very unfortunate
that we can’t feel safe in the house of our National Chairman. I am not sure
that if I visit the Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) that
they will attack me the way they did in the house of the APC National
Chairman.” “It
is unfortunate that things have degenerated to this extent. But we will
continue to sue for peace. We cannot afford to lose the gains of the last three
years. We will continue to pursue peace,” he added. Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
