By Callistus Agwaza, Jalingo The Taraba State Water Supply
Agency  on Monday commenced the enumeration of over 66,000 households
across five local government areas in the state to build the agency’s customer
data base for effective and efficient service delivery. The General Manager of the agency Mr
Musa Siam who disclosed this at the agency’s office in Jalingo on Monday
further revealed  that over 90
enumerators have been engaged deployed for the first phase of the exercise
which covers Jalingo, Wukari, Ibi, Takum and Gembu towns. Siam said the exercise is aimed at
” identifying, revalidating and updating the present utility customer
database of the agency for effective water supply service delivery and for
future planning”. He said that as a self -ustaining
agency that would soon start surviving on the revenue it generates, a strong
database of existing and prospective customers is very important for effective
operations. Siam said that due to security
concerns, “enumerators are drawn from the communities to avoid possible
apprehension and fear of intrusion that could possibly put the lives of the
people at risk”. He called on the people to cooperate
with the enumerators and provide necessary information as such data which would
be obtained from the field will help the agency to serve the people better and
to address other critical issues of sanitation and hygiene in the state. The exercise which is with support
from the USAID Effective Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Services (E-WASH)
program will last for about six weeks. Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
