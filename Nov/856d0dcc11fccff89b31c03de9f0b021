President Muhammadu Buhari has made
a strong demand for exemplary conduct of non-partisanship on the part of
election and law enforcement officials in Saturday’s governorship elections in
Bayelsa and Kogi. The president, in a statement by his
Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu in Abuja on
Thursday, noted that on Nov. 16, voters in two states would be left alone to
decide who takes charge of the administration of their important states for the
next four years. He further observed that since the
ban on campaigns was lifted a few weeks ago, their citizens had been called to
attend political rallies of various hues and were bombarded with political
advertisements. According to him, the campaigns have
so far recorded not a few uninspiring incidents of violence and of intemperate
use of language. He, therefore, stated that all
stakeholders in the conduct of the elections must carry out their functions
with fairness and transparency; without let or hindrance and without fear or
favour. Buhari said: “I call on voters in
Bayelsa and Kogi to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner
and in line with the law in all situations. ”Law enforcement officials must
ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation
and any attempt to steal or hijack ballots must be stopped using all legal
means. “In all democratic elections, there
are bound to be winners and losers and the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi will
not be different. ”All candidates should be ready to
accept the outcomes and wherever they are dissatisfied, they should follow the
due process of the law in seeking redress. There must not be a resort to
self-help.” The president wished the two states
and their peoples a safe and credible exercise as they vote in these ”historic
and suspenseful elections”.(NAN)
