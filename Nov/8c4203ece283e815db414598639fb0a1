By Yemi Itodo As Bayelsans throng out in their
numbers to vote for a new governor, the electorate at units 7 and 9 in Opolo
are being disenfranchised. This, was even as, two supporters of
the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) were feared dead and were rushed to the
hospital immediately. Trouble started when, some armed
thugs appeared at the voting centre, at a time the election materials were been
conveyed, preventing the Adhoc staff of the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) from offloading the materials. “They said there was not going
to be any election except we allowed them thump print all for the APC. We
insisted election must hold, but they started shooting and everyone became
scared. “Go there and see blood
everywhere. They shot two guys who have been taken to the hospital. We don’t
want to lose our lives. “Since they don’t want the
election in their area, we are leaving, because our lives are more important to
us”, a female Corps Member posted to the area (name withheld) told our
reporter. One of the locals who identified
himself as Frank, also told our reporter that the thugs were believed to be
working for the All Progressive Congress (APC), as they insisted that all votes
must be done in favour of the party. He said, “the Hoodlums came to
Opolo near the town hall and cut the hand of one of the PDP boys and shot one
in the head, they have been taken for treatment. “The boys ran back to Udeme
Hotel after their action”, saying, he believed they were lodged in a hotel
belonging to a former federal lawmaker. When our reporter visited the scene,
operatives of the Nigeria Police and Department of State Services had taken
over the environment, providing security for the election materials which were
to be returned to INEC office, Yenagoa. Like!! Thank you for publishing this awesome article.
