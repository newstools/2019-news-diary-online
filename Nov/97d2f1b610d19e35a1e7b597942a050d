 The  Court of Appeal
sitting in Port Harcourt has granted a stay of execution of the ruling of the
Federal High Court Port Harcourt which had earlier barred the All Progressives
Congress candidates from running for gubernatorial  election Saturday.. The candidate through his lawyers had approached the  Court of Appeal  and filed a motion of stay of execution of the
High Court ruling in Yenagoa, pending the determination of the case by the
Court of Appeal. Ruling on the matter 
Friday, the Court of Appeal sitting in Port HarCourt   granted 
the  stay of execution of the  Federal High Court ruling. With this ruling in Port Harcourt and the Court of Apeal
ruling in Abuja, the courts have  ordered
a stay of execution. Effectively, the All Progressives Congress Candidate,David
Lyon and his  running mate are  free to contest in the Bayelsa State
gubernatorial election. Speaking on the stay of execution a lawyer who was in court
said “the implication is that the effect of the judgement of the Federal High
court is suspended.It is assume there was no judgement at all until when  the Court of Appeal hears the matter.If they
later agree with the jdugement, the ruling comes back. “With what we got in the court of Appeal  Abuja andthis one,it means that David Lyon
and (his running mate) are the APC candidates 
for this gubernatorial election tomorrow(Saturday).That is the
implication. Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
