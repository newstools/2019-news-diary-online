Suspected  kidnappers have attacked some  Federal
Road Safety Corps personnel travelling from  Abuja to Lagos   on an
official assignment at Oshawa along  highway at about 1:50 pm on Friday,
killing the driver and leaving the other staff in the vehicle critically
injured. According to a statement made
available by Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Public Education Officer, the two personnel
who were travelling in a Toyota Hilux pick-up van with registration number;
PILOT 01A were ambushed by the gunmen after Zariagi on Lokoja – Okene road
precisely at  Oshawa, a town close to Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. The kidnappers, according to first
information report, were said to have opened fire at the sight of the marked
vehicle and unfortunately shot the driver in the head, killing him instantly. The vehicle subsequently lost
control and veered off the road.  It took hours before the rescue team
could locate the vehicle in the bush and evacuate the victims. The Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi
has expressed his heartfelt sympathy to the family of the bereaved, the entire
management and staff of the Corps, and the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the
death of the officer who lost his life in active service. The incident has since been reported
to the Nigeria Police Force for immediate investigation. Like!! Great article post.Really thank you! Really Cool.
