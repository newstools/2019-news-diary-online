President
Muhammad Buhari says investments cannot thrive in an atmosphere of social and
political instability, so, the Federal Government would do all within its powers
to safeguard the interest of investors. According to a press release by Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, the President spoke at State House, Abuja, Thursday, while playing host to the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Total Group Worldwide, Mr Patrick Pouyanne. Said President
Buhari: “The relationship between us and Total has been long and mutually
beneficial. We want it to remain so. We have to be honourable, honest, and work
together, so that we can improve. At our end, we promise social and political
stability, so that you can recover your investments. It’s our duty as
government, and we will do it, so that we can maintain mutual confidence in
each other.” Mr Pouyanne
disclosed that apart from oil and gas, which is its core activity, Total was
also willing to develop the solar power potentials of Nigeria. “Our portfolio
is large. We have many more projects to come. The prospects for Nigeria in oil
and gas remain huge. More developing activities are possible, and we need to
keep the momentum, and commit more investments to Nigeria,” he said. Like!! Thank you for publishing this awesome article.
