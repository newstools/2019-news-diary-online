The Department of State Services (DSS) on Friday confirmed  that it has received the Court Order for the
release of Omoyele Sowore. However, Peter Afunanya, spokesman of  DSS who disclosed this development in a statement added , “It is important that the public notes that since the receipt of the Order, no person has turned up at the DSS to take delivery of him. He said “This becomes imperative for reasons of
accountability. “However, the Court has been properly briefed on this
development and the steps being taken to ensure compliance with its Order. Afunaya said “The Service, under the leadership of Yusuf
Magaji Bichi (fwc), as the Director General, is not a lawless organization and
will never obstruct justice or disobey Court Orders. “It, therefore, affirms that it will do all that is needful
once the appropriate processes have been concluded.” Like!! I blog quite often and I genuinely thank you for your information. The article has truly peaked my interest.
