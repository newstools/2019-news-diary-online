The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) worldwide has commended the
President of the Senate, Dr.  Ahmed Lawan
and the entire Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for barring the
illegal interim Management Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission
(NDDC) from defending the 2019/2020 budget of the Commission. In a press statement signed by Barrister Eric Omare,
President, the IYC Worldwide said “the Senate has by this decision once
again demonstrated its capacity to defend the rule of law and democracy in
Nigeria.” Recalling that “when the NDDC Act was passed in the year
2000, the then President Obasanjo refused to assent to the bill as passed by
the National Assemnly because of the funding provisions, Barrister Omare said,
” however, the National Assembly led by the charismatic Dr. Chuba Okadigbo
as Senate President and Hon. Ghali Umar Na’Abah as Speaker of the House of
Representatives stood on the side of the people of the Niger Delta region and
vetoed the presidential assent and passed the NDDC Act into law and established
the NDDC. In effect the NDDC is a baby of the National Assembly and we are glad
that the present National Assembly lived up to the expectation of the people of
the Niger Delta region by coming out to defend the survival of the NDDC.” The Ijaw Youth Congress President called on the House of
Representatives to “follow the lead that has been provided by the Senate
and also bar the illegal IMC from coming to defend the 2019/2020 NDDC
budget.” The premier Ijaw youth organisation called on the National
Assembly to “probe the expenditures of the illegal Interim Management
Committee and sanction those culpable for spending money from the funds of
federal government without parliamentary authorization.” [url=http://albuterolcheapestoffers.com]www.albuterolcheapestoffers.com[/url]
