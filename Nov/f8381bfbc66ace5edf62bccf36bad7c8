A foremost Ijaw leader and
a Chieftain of All Progressives Congress, Hon. Prince Kakas Amgbare has
congratulated the governor-elect of Bayelsa State Chief David Lyon for his
victory in the recently concluded elections. In a statement released in Yenagoa
earlier Monday, and obtained by our correspondent, he thanked voters from the
state for turning out massively in support of the wind of change. According to him “ I am extremely pleased with
the way Bayelsans demonstrated overwhelming support for David Lyon. It speaks
volumes about the belief of ordinary people in his capacity to deliver
dividends of democracy” The chieftain also thanked the leader of All
Progressives Congress (APC) in the state Chief Timipre Sylva and former
President Goodluck Jonathan for all their efforts to make change happen. Let me
also thank High Chief Government Ekpemupolo aka Tompolo for all the sacrifices
he has made to bring Ijaw nation together. According to him, “this
victory is an affirmation of what is possible when Ijaws can once against speak
with one voice”.  He further urged all
Bayelsans from all political persuasions to unite, heal their differences, put
the past behind them and support the new government of change to succeed in
transforming the state for the benefit of all. Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
