At the 6th annual Hollywood Weekly Magazine
Film Festival, the world got to hear about the precarious political state of
Nigeria when Atiku Abubakar was acknowledged as the “Peoples’ President” in
front of an illustrious academy of movie makers in Hollywood, California,
United States of America. #FreeLeahSharibu activist, Reno Omokri, was
honoured with the Humanitarian Cause of the Year Award at the ceremony, and
when called to receive his award, he dedicated it to the duo of Atiku Abubakar
and former President Goodluck Jonathan. “In Nigeria, where I am from, we are all Leah
Sharibus, because our rights, our freedoms and our economy have been abducted
by a brutal backward, Stone Age dictator, named General Buhari, who is using
every trick in the book to prevent the person that Nigerians genuinely elected
as their President, the People’s President, Atiku Abubakar, from claiming his
mandate. If everybody will keep quiet, I will not keep quiet. And that is why I
dedicate this award to Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, the last democrat to govern
Nigeria, and to Atiku Abubakar, the People’s President. Atiku Abubakar is
represented today, by his son, Abba Atiku, and I invite him to say a word or
two”, Reno said. On his part, Abba Atiku, spoke and said “I
know that the Nigerian people elected my father. However, as true Muslims, we
have left the situation in Nigeria to the Almighty Allah. But I salute the
courage and bravery of Leah Sharibu. And on behalf of my father, I hereby award
Leah Sharibu a scholarship to the American University of Nigeria, Yola,
whenever, she is freed”. Here’s
