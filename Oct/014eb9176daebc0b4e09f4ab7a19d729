President
Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday held talks with King Salman in Riyadh, on the
sidelines of the second day of the Future Investment Initiative (FII)
conference, during which both leaders committed to deeper partnership for the
development of both countries. President
Buhari and the Saudi Monarch reviewed aspects of cooperation between both
countries and agreed to advance cooperation in the areas of oil and gas, given
the similarities of both countries as big producers of the commodity. In
this regard, King Salman assured President Buhari of the willingness of Saudi
Arabia to invest in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector, thereby strengthening the
strategic partnership between the Saudi Energy company, Aramco, and the NNPC. Both
leaders also discussed the current regional and global security situation, and
President Buhari expressed his desire for a quick and peaceful resolution on
contentious issues in the region. Noting
the cordial relations Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, the two leaders committed to
vigorously enhance and develop relations in several areas – from trade,
people-to-people partnership, technology, education and agriculture, for the
mutual prosperity of citizens of both countries.
