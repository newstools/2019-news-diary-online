Attorney-General of the Federation
Abubakar Malami on Wednesday called for the approval of 2.5 per cent as
requisite commission arising from recovery of off-shore stolen assets from the
country. He made the appeal while defending
the Ministry of Justice 2020 budget estimates before the Senate Committee on
Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters at the National Assembly. Malami who said that a unit in the
ministry had deposited all recovered assets so far into Federal Government
Treasury, insisted that “we need requisite commission to replenish our
efforts.” The attorney-general also said that
the ministry was mandated to take inventory and explore avenues for the payment
of judgment-debt which had became hydra headed. “This has arisen because it was only
in 2017 that N10 billion was disbursed for the payment of judgment-debt as
appropriated. “As it stands, N150 billion remains
unpaid, prompting beneficiaries of this sum to keep mounting pressures on the
ministry,” he said. Chairman of the Committee, Sen.
Opeyemi Bamidele said that the committee would perform legislative oversight
over the ministry and agencies that reported to it. “The  committee is worried
about the judgment-debt profile of the country which keeps soaring by the day
as there are no corresponding  budgetary allocations to handle such. “It is on record that the last
allocation the ministry got for judgment-debt was in the 2017 Appropriation Act
where N10 billion was appropriated. “The committee is deeply concerned
with the failure of our government  to service its judgment-debt as
expected, which has put our image before the international community at stake. “The committee would strive to ensure
that budgetary provisions are made to offset the debt burden,” Bamidele
said.(NAN) Like!! Great article post.Really thank you! Really Cool.
