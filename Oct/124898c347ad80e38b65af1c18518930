the Nigerian leader will make a statement at the summit on Thursday, October 24th,
2019. Other
participants at the summit that will showcase Russian interest and investment
potential in Africa include businessmen, experts, investors, leaders of major
sub-regional associations and organisations. An African Business Forum, which will bring together African and
Russian business leaders, will be held during the event to enhance Russian
investments in Africa, and promote African business interest in the host

forum. “It
is important that this meeting is taking place at this time,’’ says, Malam Shehu. “All the big nations are picking
stronger interest in Africa. We now have US-Africa Summit, India-Africa Summit,
China-Africa Summit and Japan-Africa Summit, so Russia has signified its
interest on political, cultural and economic partnership. “Nigeria has had an excellent
relationship with Russia over the years. We will not forget how the country
assisted us in keeping Nigeria as one during the civil war when some our
traditional allies deserted us. “They have also stood behind us in the
fight against terrorism, Boko Haram and ISWA, and Russia has demonstrated its
capacity in gas production, a resource which Nigeria has a huge potential of
utilising,’’ he added. Shehu said the summit will look into
issues of sustainable energy, mines and steel, infrastructure development in
Africa, nuclear energy and trade and investment. On security, the Senior Special
Assistant said the meeting will come up with proposals for a new security
architecture that will be heavily driven by new technology. President Buhari is accompanied by
