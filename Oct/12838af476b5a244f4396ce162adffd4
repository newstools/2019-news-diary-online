A human  rights and good
governance advocacy group  – Make A Difference Initiative  (MAD) has
applauded Justice Sybil Nwaka for imposing a 60- year jail term on a
paedophile, Mr. Adegboyea Adekan for raping a 2- year old girl. Justice Nwaka of the Ikeja Domestic
Violence and Sexual Offences imposed the historic sentence after finding
Paedophilie Adenekan, guilty of child defilement. In  a statement issued by the
Communication and Advocacy Director of MAD, Lemmy Ughegbe he said “Justice
Sybil Nwaka deserves our plaudits for her courage and sensitivity in imposing a
historic jail term on the former supervisor of a school.” Ughegbe  noted that “until
now, magistrates and judges have been handling sentencing of paedophiles and
other sex offenders with kid’s gloves by imposing ridiculously low jail
term.” However, he expressed optimism that
“the 60 year sentence imposed on Adenekan by Justice Nwaka would open the
vista for judicial officers to take sentencing of sex offenders more seriously
going forward.” “It is our firm position that
rape and defilement should attract a life sentence if we are to curb this
menace, which always leaves the victim and his / her society with grave
psycho-social consequences”, he stated. He called on Heads of courts
nationwide to “as a matter of deliberate policy and practice bring in more
women to handle cases around rape, defilement and sundry sexual offences
because they are better wired to appreciate such situations. He also advocated for the
establishment of special courts in states to deal expeditiously with
allegations  sexual offences While delivering her verdict,
Justice Nwaka described Adenekan, as “wicked, conscienceless and an animal who
is not worthy of walking on the streets of Lagos”. “Schools should not cover up
teachers who sexually abuse children. Parents should not be carried away by
aesthetics of schools. This case may just be the tip of the iceberg as a lot of
our children are suffering in silence,” the judge held.
