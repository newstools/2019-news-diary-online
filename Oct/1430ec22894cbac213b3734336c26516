By Abdallah el-Kurebe The Centre for Development and Advanced Learning (CENDAL), will collaborate with Connected Development (CODE), to host the first Universities SDGs Summit in Ahmadu Bello University, ABU Zaria early next year. One of CENDAL’s mandate is to promote educational excellence in and around the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. A statement jointly signed by the Director of CENDAL Nigeria, Suleiman Muhammad Murkthar and Chief Executive of CODE, Hamzat B Lawal and made available to Newsdiaryonline on Sunday said the Summit, which is scheduled to hold between February 27th and 1st March, 2020 seeks to host students and professionals from different institutions in Nigeria. It added that participants will drive more awareness around the United Nations Global Goals for sustainable development. “The Summit would be featuring Panel Discussions and Paper Presentations from VCs and other key individuals from the academia and other institutions. Awards would also be issued to students and other institutions for their active contribution to the Global Goals. “With just ten years (2020) until the next review for the SDGs, the pertinence of collaboration cannot be overemphasized. “The summit will hold annually in different universities around the country, leading to the next review of the United Nations. Every year, a compendium of the summit, detailing students concerns, communiques from the summit panels and suggestions on how the government and the United Nations itself could further advance better achievement of the goals, would be published,” the statement read. It further stated that the compendium would serve as a referral document for public consumption. The Summit organisers there invited universities and other interested stakeholders to attend the event. “The Centre invites universities, organizations and other promoters of the SDGs to join in the summit.”
