The All Progressives Congress (APC) has
condemned Saturday evening’s attack on the Benin residence of the Party’s
National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole by political thugs. National Publicity Secretary , All Progressives Congress (APC), Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said in a statement Sunday, “Although, the APC National Chairman has rightly called for calm after the apparent attempt on his life, we call on the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu,mni  and other relevant security outfits to investigate the ugly incident and prosecute the sponsors and attackers. “In Edo State, just as in any other
state, everyone must be free to go about their normal and legitimate activities
without harassment, intimidation, threat to life and property. He added that “It is clear that the
sponsors of the attack are bent on causing crisis in the state in pursuit of
their desperate and unpopular political interests. Human life is greater that
anyone’s political ambition.” Like!! Really appreciate you sharing this blog post.Really thank you! Keep writing.
