President Muhammadu Buhari has described the death of
retired Deputy Inspector General of Police, Muhammadu Danmadami as a great loss
to the country. Condoling with the family and friends on the passage
of the late DIG, the President described him as a remarkably dedicated officer. “I am saddened by the news of Danmadami’s death at
this time when his valuable experiences were needed by the country. “Even in retirement, the valuable advice of such a
dedicated officer was relevant to the country’s security challenges. “Late Danmadami, who was also the traditional title
holder of Sa’in Katagum, had left a distinguished and untainted record of
service to the country. His contributions will be remembered for years to
come,” President Buhari said. He prayed to God to bless the soul of the deceased and
grant his family the fortitude to overcome this loss. Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
