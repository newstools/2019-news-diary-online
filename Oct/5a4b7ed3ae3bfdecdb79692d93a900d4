the purported attack on the person or the residence of former Governor of the
state and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade

“We have no knowledge of the attack. We have also reached out to the
Police, and they affirmed that they do not know about such an attack.” Like!! I blog frequently and I really thank you for your content. The article has truly peaked my interest.
