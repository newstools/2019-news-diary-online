The Edo State Commissioner
of Police, DanMallam Muhammed, has restated the State Police Command’s position
that there was no attack on the person or residence of former Governor of the
state and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade
Adams Oshiomhole. Muhammed,
who said this in a chat with journalists on Monday, debunked allegations of an
attack on the former governor, warning troublemakers to steer clear of the
state. The
Police Commissioner said the Police beefed up security around the APC National
Chairman while his visit to the State lasted, during which no attack was
recorded. “To
the best of my knowledge, no one had access to the house of the National
Chairman. When he came into the State, we beefed up security around him, from
his house to the Oba’s palace, from there to the airport before he left for
Abuja. “Let
me use this medium to warn trouble makers that Edo State is very peaceful and
calm. The State is the most peaceful in the South-South Region of Nigeria. We
will do everything according to the law to ensure that the peace the people of
Edo State enjoy is not truncated and any attempt by anyone to cause trouble in
the State will be resisted with maximum force,” he noted. A
Chieftain of the APC in the state, Charles Idahosa, described the allegations
as efforts by unscrupulous elements to heat up the polity so that evil elements
can have their way.
