An Anambra High Court, sitting in Otuocha, Anambra East council area, will on Wednesday decide the fate of seven murder suspects accused of complicity in the death of two persons in Nkwele Ezunaka.The court, which was presided over by Justice Mike Okonkwo, would determine its jurisdiction over the accused persons, who were in connection with the alleged murder of Ikechukwu Opene and Samson Aliegwu in January 2018. The court will also decide whether the suspects were entitled to be admitted to bail or not. The suspects were Chukwuka Nnonyelu, Ezeayom Chinonso, alias Ikemba, Sunday Okeke, Ifeanyi Samuel, Austine Lucky, Obiorah Okafor and Obi Jideofor. Mr A.C. Anaenugwu, Counsel for the first defendant, Chinonso, had challenged the jurisdiction of the court over the matter, while S. O. Nnabugwu, counsel for the third and fourth defendants applied for their bail. But the Chief State Counsel, C.G Okonkwo-Okom, in a counter application, said that the court had jurisdiction over the matter because the “charges against the defendants include capital offence of murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms.” Okonkwo-Okom also stated that charges against them, as contained in suit number No. OT/21C/2019, were covered by the provisions of Section 142 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, 2010.She argued that granting accelerated hearing on the matter to determine the defendants’ innocence or otherwise would serve the interest of justice in the case. She further argued that the application seeking for the defendants’ bail “did not place before the court, any exceptional, unusual or special circumstances to warrant the court to exercise its discretion to grant bail in favour of the applicant.” The case was adjourned to Oct. 16 for argument and determination of the issue of jurisdiction.
