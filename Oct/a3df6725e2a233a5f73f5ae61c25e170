Speaking for the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr Paul Usoro (SAN), represented by Mr, A.T Kehinde (SAN), said the partnership between the Bench and the Bar should not be stained by external forces. According to him, it should be remembered that both the Bar and Bench are from the same parents. He added that without the bar there would be no bench and the Bar would be emasculated. “Therefore, the synergy between us must continue for the delivery of justice that would be obvious to the ordinary man on the street. “The bench, it is noted, has been under trial from the media, security agencies and the public, who do not even understand the modus operandi of the Bench, ‘’  he said. According to Usoro, unfortunately, the ‘Bench has no voice to defend itself ‘ therefore, the bar should stand in defence of the Bench. Speaking for the body of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Abuja branch, Mr Chris Uche (SAN), said independence of the judiciary was necessary. According to him, the body sought to lend its voice to the issue that is of great concern in the profession, “that is the independence of the judiciary as an indispensable component of the Rule of Law”. Uche said that there was no gainsaying the fact that the judiciary in Nigeria was undergoing very trying times. He added that the general feeling was that the judiciary was under a siege, noting that this year had been quite challenging. “We attended the International Bar Association Conference in Seoul, and our major takeaway was the showcase symposium on the Rule of Law, which had such huge message for Nigeria. “The focus was on the assault by some governments around the world on the rule of law and attacks on the independence of the judiciary and of the legal profession,’’ he said.
