First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari returned to Nigeria Sunday morning after what her media aide, Suleiman Haruna, described as “a long holiday in the UK.” Haruna who announced her return said she arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at 4.30am via a British Airways flight. Speaking to reporters on arrival, Mrs. Buhari said she was happy to be home after a well-deserved rest, the statement said. The First Lady also confirmed that she was fully rejuvenated to continue the work of improving the health and well-being of women, children and other vulnerable Nigerians. Aisha according to Haruna, “used the opportunity to thank her husband, family and well-wishers for their support and encouragement.” On hand to receive her were wives of present and former and governors and many associates, Aisha’s media aide said. Newsdiaryonline reports that Aisha returned two days after social media reports of President Buhari’s plan to take a serving minister as his second wife on Friday turned out as a monumental hoax.
