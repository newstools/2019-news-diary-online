President Muhammadu
Buhari has urged Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State to set a
standard for good governance that might be used to reinforce confidence in the
country’s younger political leaders. According to a press release signed by Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), Buhari stated this in a congratulatory message to the governor on his 52nd birthday anniversary celebration. Delivering the
message on his behalf by Sarki Abba, the Senior Special Assistant (Domestic
Affairs and Social Events) President Buhari said: “I
am proud to say that you have started off well. You should therefore not rest
on your oars until the people feel the impact of good governance. Your
performance will be the yardstick by which our youth will be rated in this
democracy.

“My administration is fully committed to supporting our youth to succeed
because the country looks upon them for future leadership. As one of our
youngest leaders, let your performance be an inspiration for others,
thereby galvanising our youth to participate actively in making Nigeria a
better country.” The President
reminded the Adamawa State governor that, “Poverty is one of the enormous
challenges facing our democracy, and leaders at all levels should work hard to
address this issue because of its direct bearing on criminality in the
country.” “While
congratulating you on the good work you have started, I urge you not to rest on
your oars because complacency is number one enemy of success. You should do
everything to address the problem of youth restiveness caused by
unemployment which in turn, leads to crime,” President Buhari further
enjoined Gov. Fintiri.
