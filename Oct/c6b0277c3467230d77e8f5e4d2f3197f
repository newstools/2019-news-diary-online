For allegedly refusing to allow a Pastor access his Website, the Police on Thursday has charged a 28 years old man, Oluwatosin Olawuyi, in an Ojo Magistrates’Court in Lagos. Olawuyi was charged on one count of committing a breach of peace which the police said contravened the provisions of Sections 168 (d) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015. The prosecutor, Insp. Simon Uche, told the court that the defendant committed the offence in February. He said that Olawuyi, who is a designer of Websites, had designed a blog for a Pastor, one Rev. Sunday but had willfully refused to allow the complainant access to his blog, adding that the conduct of the defendant prevented the complainant from imputing information in his site. Meanwhile, when allowed to speak, the complainant explained to the court that he engaged the defendant to design his blog since the beginning of the year and had paid him the required fees for the job. He said Olawuyi refused to give him the password to his blog and instead devised means of extorting more from him, adding that the illegal demand was not acceptable to him. “He has hacked my blog, I cannot input information in my site and I have been demanding for my password ever since, but he refused to give it to me, ” he said. He said as a man of God, he decided to send his fellow Pastors to the defendant, to advise him on the need to desist from such “fraudulent conduct“ and issue him the password to his site so as to avoid problem. He told the court that the defendant remained indifferent to his pleas and warning, following which he invited the police. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the  charge while the Magistrate, Mr A. A Adesanya, granted him bail in the sum of N100,000 with two responsible sureties in like sum with an order that the sureties must show evidence of tax clearance. The magistrate adjourned the case until Dec. 17 for mention. (NAN)
