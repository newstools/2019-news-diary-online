The Plateau Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) says it is ready to join the nationwide industrial action as directed by its national leadership, should Tuesday’s meeting between the Federal Government and labour unions on the consequential adjustments arising from the N30,000 minimum wage fail to produce the desired results for workers. The Chairman of the council, Mr Eugene Manji, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Jos that the council had been directed by the national leadership of the union to be on standby in case a resolution on the new minimum wage was not reached at the meeting. “We are on standby and in readiness for action.“We have fully mobilised our affiliate unions and we are all waiting for the next directive from the national leadership on the outcome of the meeting. “I can assure you that Plateau Council is ready to comply with any directive handed down by the national body,” Manji said.He, therefore, advised all workers in the state to be ready for action, in case a strike was declared.
