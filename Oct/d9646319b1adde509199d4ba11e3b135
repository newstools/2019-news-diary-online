Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara has called on traditional rulers in the North to join hands with government in restoring the lost glory of the region. A statement made available to journalists in Gusau by the Director-General Press Affairs to the governor, Yusuf Idris, said Matawalle made the call in Azare, Bauchi state when he paid homage on the Emir of Katagum, Alhaji Umar Faruk at his palace on Wednesday. Matawalle noted that as custodians of norms and values of the region, traditional rulers should partner with government at all levels to restore peace, unity and understanding among people of the region. The governor said the role played by the traditional rulers in the past contributed immensely to the peace and development that the citizens enjoyed in the region. He therefore emphasised the need for traditional rulers to support government in the fight against all forms of criminality, so as  to have a developed region, free from all forms of crimes. Responding, the Emir of Katagum, thanked Matawalle for the visit and pledged to make the governor’s call top on his priority list. Farouk pointed out that peace remained the only option for attaining meaningful development. The Emir commended the governor for restoring peace in Zamfara through dialogue within the short period of his administration. (NAN)
