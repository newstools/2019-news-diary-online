Bama Initiative for Human
Development has called on the Federal Government to expedite action on
implementation of the Bama Initiative project. It said that this would fast track
the recovery and resettlement of communities ravaged by the Boko Haram
insurgents in Borno. Mr Muhammad Hassan, the Chairman of
the organisation, made the call on Sunday in Maiduguri, at a press conference
to commemorate the five-year anniversary of the insurgents’ attack on Bama
community. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
recalls that Bama, the second largest town in Borno was on Sept. 1, 2014
ransacked by Boko Haram insurgents. According to statistics by the Borno
State Government, over 1,000 people were killed and about 98 per cent of
residential houses and public infrastructure destroyed in the town by the
insurgents. Hassan noted that the Bama
Initiative project was initiated by President Muhammad Buhari to reconstruct,
rehabilitate and resettle the ravaged community. “We appeal to the Federal Government
to commence the reconstruction of Bama under the pilot scheme of Bama
Initiative. “We equally commend the president
over the approval of N48 billion towards actualisation of the Bama Initiative. “The project is designed to
facilitate construction of 3,000 houses; 18 schools, 10 Divisional Police
stations, clinics, water and electrical facilities as well as rehabilitation of
Maiduguri to Bama to Banki Highway,” he said. The chairman also lauded Gov.
Babagana Zulum over the state government’s support to the military and other
security agencies as well as enhanced allowances for members of the Civilian
Joint Task Force (CJTF). While calling on the people to pray
for peace and stability, he urged them to support government’s policies and
programmes for rapid recovery, sustainable social and economic development of
the state. (NAN)
