The Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB),Prof. Isa Mohammed, said inter-agency collaboration, is an essential ingredient needed in effectively combating corruption and terrorist financing in the country. Mohammed,  represented by Mr Murtala Kankia, made the call in Abuja at a roundtable among top management staff of  the CCB. He noted that such collaboration would complement Federal Government’s efforts at checking corrupt practices. The meeting, organised by the European Union for board members of the bureau was aimed at reviewing and updating its activities for the benefits of the civil servants. ”It is important to review the operations of CCB in light with current realities, given the fact that the Bureau is the leading agency in the fight against corruption. ”But then, we cannot work on our own, we need the support and collaboration of other anti-corruption agencies,’’ it stated. The chairman had said that it was important for political appointees as well as public officers to see the need to declare their assets as part of methods of fighting corruption. He had noted that such act would make public officers to be cautious in their dealings, and responsible to the public and government for development.(NAN)
