The Almajiri Child Right Initiative, ACRI has  announced its plan to  launch the Almajiri Child Goals campaign. This announcement was made in a statement by ACRI on Friday. Mohammed Sabo Keana,  Team Lead and other members of the group said in the statement that the move is part of their bid to maintain momentum. Part
of  statement said, “To maintain ..
momentum and ensure a different approach is adopted to address the Almajiri
Child rights crisis, on September 25 the Almajiri Child Rights Initiative will
launch Almajiri Child Goals, the next phase of our previous accountability
campaign demanding government actions towards the education and social
inclusion rights of Almajiri children. “This
phase of the campaign is aimed at focusing Government proposed interventions
towards addressing Almajiri phenomenon on all the factors that combine to
promote and sustain the Almajiri Child Rights Crisis and not just lack of
education alone. Previous intervention focusing on education rights alone has
not yielded any meaningful impact. “We
believe that addressing the Almajiri crisis within the framework of Almajiri
Child Goals will ensure holistic and more sustainable solutions and not charity
like interventions that conceal the issue and shrug off real government
responsibility to the poor. The Almajiri Child Goals are not optional and will
serve as our yardstick for assessing government-proposed interventions. The
Almajiri Child Goals are a set of nine (9) SDGs whose achievement or otherwise
has a direct impact on the lives of Almajiri children – No Poverty, Zero
Hunger, Healthcare and Wellbeing, Quality Education, Clean Water and Sanitation,
Decent Work, Reduced Inequality, Peace and Social Justice. “While
we wait for government to take responsibility, the campaign is working to1)
Localize the SDGs to policy makers using the #AlmajiriChildGoals 2) empower
local communities to demand for accountability around goals that affects their
children 3) Enlighten Mallams -Teachers in the Almajiri School System and Parents on proposed government reforms
plans for their acceptability 4) inspire Public support for the Vulnerable
children within the community they live. They are innocent children and victims
of our collective irresponsibility. Apathy towards their plight is not an
option. The
statement disclosed that “We are partnering with individuals to send 500
Almajiri Children to ‘CLAS’ (Community Learning Almajiri School) where they
have the opportunity of having both secular and religious type Education taught
within their community. “We
are providing medical outreach, food and nonfood items like shoes, clothes and
toiletries to over 5000 Almajiri children across the states. “We
are Launching AlmaCare to provide and encourage free Healthcare support for sick
Almajiri children within the community while we advocate for the full and
immediate implementation of National Health Act. Read

years from now, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) hope to
have eliminated hunger, ensured quality education and decent work for all, and
achieved 15 more things aimed at leaving no one behind. Sadly, at our current
pace, over 9 million Almajiri children will be part of those who have been
failed by the rest of us. In
pursuit of much needed reforms to align with the SDGs, our organization has
worked over the last five years to bring visibility and increased public awareness
to the plight of these children. In May, as one of 21 organizations that made
up the global recipients for the UN SDG Awards in Bonn Germany, we took the
plight of the children to the global 
stage and on the 2nd Anniversary of Almajiri child rights Day on May 25,
we declared that “Nigeria, and the world, cannot achieve the SDGs without
addressing the Almajiri child rights crisis where over 9 million children are
socially excluded in Nigeria . The declaration was made simultaneously by
Almajiri child rights advocates across 17 northern states and beyond. Gladly
the call has enabled government action at all levels. To
maintain this momentum and ensure a different approach is adopted to address
the Almajiri Child rights crisis, on September 25 the Almajiri Child Rights
Initiative will launch Almajiri Child Goals, the next phase of our previous
accountability campaign demanding government actions towards the education and
social inclusion rights of Almajiri children. This
phase of the campaign is aimed at focusing Government proposed interventions
towards addressing Almajiri phenomenon on all the factors that combine to
promote and sustain the Almajiri Child Rights Crisis and not just lack of

Almajiri CHILD, a biweekly Sanitation Initiative to improve hygiene and
wellbeing within Almajiri set-ups We
are also using this day to continue with our campaign #13millionsignatures –
representing the estimated total number of out-of-school children in Nigeria to
collect signatures to demand increased investment in education for all Nigerian
girls and Almajiri children. The
Launch of Almajiri child goals and global day of impact for Almajri Child will
take place across 17 northern states, Lagos, Imo and by our friends & SDGs
advocates in Indian, Japan , Russia, UK and at the United Nations building in
New York on the 25th of September to mark the Global week of Action to
#ACT4SDGs. We invite all Nigerians and SDGs advocates across the world to take
part on this day to #Act4SDGs by amplifying the #AlmajiriChildGoals and hold
government accountable for a sustainable solution to the Almajiri child rights
crisis. With
at least 8 of the 17 SDGs interconnected to the plight of Almajiri children, it
simply means that nowhere in the world are child rights as critical to the
attainment of SDGs as Northern Nigeria. It is an urgency driven by both time
and demography that neither Nigeria nor the world can afford to miss if we are
to meet our global target by 2030. Signatories
