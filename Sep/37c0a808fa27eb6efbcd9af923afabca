We have decided to give a right of reply and publish the “request” which came via an email from a body or agency simply identified as  BHM in full: Re: HEDA’s Ultimatum to
SEC for the Sack of MTN Board Members We refer to the post with the headline “HEDA asks SEC
to sack Ndukwe, Omobola Johnson from MTN board” that was published on your
platform on Sunday, September 15th, 2019, at about 11:31 am. According to the story, the Human and Environmental Development

offer the South African communications concern undue advantage in Nigeria’s
political and economic environment”. Please note that the allegations stated in the story are false.
Kindly find below the true statements of fact: We request that you use your good office to investigate and
