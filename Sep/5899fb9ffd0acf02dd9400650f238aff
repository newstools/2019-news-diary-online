In the aftermath of a  public appeal by President Muhammadu Buhari to
Governors of Benue and Taraba States as well as their traditional and political
leaders for an urgent de-escalation of the crisis between the Tiv and Jukun
ethnic groups, the two states have slated a meeting of stakeholders for Wednesday,
at the Shehu Musa Yar’adua Center, Abuja. A statement by Presidential
Spokesman, Garba Shehu said the meeting between the representatives of the two
states has been called to resolve the lingering Tiv/Jukun crisis which has of
recent, claimed lives of innocent persons and property. In addition to the two
state governors, the meeting is expected to be attended by their traditional,
religious and political leaders, as well as other stakeholders. Shehu  disclosed that the Office of the Secretary to
the Government of the Federation, OSGF, will attend the meeting as a
stakeholder and guarantor to assure full federal government backing for the
implementation of resolutions arising from the meeting. A few days ago, President
Buhari conveyed the importance of reducing tensions between the Tiv and Jukun
neighbors and maintaining peace in the two states which had witnessed series of
violent clashes.
