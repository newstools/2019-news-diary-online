The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, on Monday September 2,  2019, solicited the
support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the fight against corruption,
noting that the apex bank’s strategic position in the financial sector
makes it a necessary ally in the quest to rid Nigeria of all economic and
financial crimes. Magu,
who spoke through Usman Imam, head of Enugu office of the Commission, while
receiving a delegation from the Enugu Branch of the apex bank led by the
Controller,  Okonjo Chiedozie , noted the difficulty encountered by
the zone in keeping recovered funds in the
CBN vault. He recalls a particular incident in
which a staff of the bank was unwilling to accept $2.8million from the
Commission, insisting on being presented with a mandate authorizing the
Commission to make such a deposit. The EFCC  boss called for
understanding of the peculiar nature of the Commission’s operation in order to
overcome current challenges and foster better working relationship between the
two institutions. “ The TSA makes it difficult to
release recovered funds on bond as drafts raised often expire or funds cannot
be released to individual account. I hope something would be done to facilitate
the quick return of proceeds of crime to their rightfull owners and save EFCC
the suspicion by the public, who might not appreciate these administrative
bottlenecks,” he said. In his response,  Chiedozie  assured  of CBN’s readiness  to collaborate
with the EFCC even as he revealed that the challenge with the TSA was not peculiar to
the agency.
