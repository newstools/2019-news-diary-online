#TrackNigeria: The National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal in Calabar on Wednesday struck out the petition filed by former Senate Leader, Sen. Victor Ndoma-Egba of the APC.. Ndoma-Egba is challenging the declaration of Sen. Sandy Onor, of the PDP, as senator for the Cross River Central Senatorial District in the March 2019 general election. Delivering judgment, Justice Vincent Agbata, held that the petition was a pre-election matter and therefore struck out the case. Ndoma-Egba prayed the tribunal to cancel the election, citing his exclusion as the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Justice Agbata held that  INEC was merely obeying the judgment of the Appeal Court which nullified the candidacy of the petitioner before the election and therefore upheld the election of Onor of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Reacting, Ndoma- Egba, said he would appeal the judgment. “We are going to appeal the matter not only in the interest of the litigant but for the interest of the law,” he said. Counsel to Onor, Patrick Agi, welcomed the judgment. (NAN).
