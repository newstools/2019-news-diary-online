By Danlami Nmodu The Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting will not take place on Wednesday, September 4, 2019, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity) Garba Shehu said in a statement Tuesday evening. According President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aide, “This
is due to the fact that all the memos earlier submitted to the Council for
consideration have been returned to the various Ministries. This action will
allow Ministers who were recently sworn in have their inputs in the memos sent
by their predecessors in office. “Similarly,
the period is to enable the Ministers, who are still taking briefs from
bureaucrats in the Ministries and familiarizing themselves with their work
space, have more time to contribute to discussions at the meeting,” the
statement said. He said “They will also utilize the period of the
break to work towards the early preparation and submission of the 2020 budget
estimates.”
