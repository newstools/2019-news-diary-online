#TrackNigeria The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Tuesday, adjourned the case between the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Bauchi State government  until Sept. 10 for further hearing. Justice Nkeonye Maha, who gave the order, referred the matter back to Justice Taiwo Taiwo for further hearing. Justice Taiwo had, on Aug. 2, granted the EFCC’s prayer to freeze the First City Monument Bank (FCMB)’s Operational Account number: 0998552074 of the Bauchi State government. The EFCC, through his Counsel, Mr Abubakar Aliyu, in an Exparte Order with file number: FHC/ABJ/CS/858/2019, sought the order of the court to freeze the account pending the conclusion of the ongoing investigation by the commission. The state government presently has about N11 billion (N11,500,000,000.00) in the bank account. The judge ordered the EFCC to, within 21 days, notify the respondents; the Bauchi State government and the FCMB about the court’s decision. The judge, however, adjourned further hearing until Sept. 3. Counsel to the EFCC had told the judge that the commission was investigating a money laundering case in which the account featured prominently. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Justice Maha referred the case back to Justice Taiwo, citing a time constraint as her reason. “There are election matters that I need to decide on quickly and since Justice Taiwo will resume as vacation judge by Sept. 9, it is better my brother justice hears the case”, she said.
